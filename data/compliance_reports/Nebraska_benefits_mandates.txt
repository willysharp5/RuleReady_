The premium for continuation coverage will be equal to the plan’s full, unsubsidized single adult premium. The public servant will be responsible for paying the full premium each month through post tax payroll deduction.
| Coordination of Benefits (COB) | When an individual is covered by more than one group health plan, health plans coordinate the benefits payable to ensure that the medical provider is not paid more than the allowable medical expenses. Under COB, the primary plan pays its normal plan benefits. The secondary plan pays the difference between allowable expense and amount paid by primary plan, provided this difference does not exceed the normal plan benefits. For active public servants, the state’s health plan is always primary. For retirees & dependents, UHC will send out COB notices once a year to dependents who file a claim on the state’s health plan. |
