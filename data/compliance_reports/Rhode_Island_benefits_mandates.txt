Rhode Island Employee Benefits Mandates (like state retirement savings programs)

Overview
RISavers is overseen by the RI Office of the General Treasurer. State law requires that all businesses with five or more employees that do not offer a qualified retirement plan must offer RISavers to their employees.
An estimated 40% of Rhode Island employees do not have access to adequate retirement savings. To address this urgent need, the Rhode Island General Assembly passed a law creating RISavers to make it easier for more workers to save for their retirement. Employees are enrolled automatically but can opt out if they don’t want to participate or prefer to save another way. Contributions are processed automatically as a payroll deduction.

Many plans involve complex administration requirements, fiduciary liability, and high costs, all of which can keep employers from offering employees a retirement savings option. But RISavers is different. It offers some of the best features of popular employer plans and IRAs without the administrative burden, allowing employers to focus on their business.

RISavers is a voluntary retirement program. Saving through a Roth IRA will not be appropriate for all individuals. Employer facilitation of RISavers should not be considered an endorsement or recommendation by your employer of RISavers, Roth IRAs, or these investments. Roth IRAs are not exclusive to RISavers and can be obtained outside of the program and contributed to outside of payroll deduction. Contributing to a RISavers Roth IRA through payroll deduction offers some tax benefits and consequences. You should consult appropriate professional advice or consultation if you have questions related to taxes or investments.
