Arkansas Voting / Civic Leave

Overview
For voting purposes, military service members, their families and U.S. citizens residing overseas may use the address where they resided before entering service or their legal U.S. residence as the address where they register to vote. You may register to vote using an Arkansas Voter Registration Application or a Federal Post Card Application (FPCA SF-76). The FPCA simultaneously serves all states and territories as both a registration form and application for an absentee ballot.
Military personnel may contact their county clerk, the Federal Voting Assistance Program (FVAP) or their Voting Assistance Officer for further information or to obtain a Federal Post Card Application (FPCA). Call 1-800-438-8683 or e-mail the program at vote@fvap.gov or go to www.fvap.gov.

Covered Employers

What Should Employers Do?
If a person is a naturalized U.S. citizen, at least 18 years old, is an Arkansas resident, is not a felon who has not discharged their sentences, and has not been determined to be mentally incompetent, then that person is eligible to register and vote. Anyone who is a naturalized citizen meeting these requirements may vote if they have registered at least 30 days before the election.
Yes. You must update your voter information as soon as possible. For voters that move from one county to another, they must update their voter information no later than four days prior to a scheduled election.
You must register to vote wherever you actually “live or reside.” Owning property or a business in a county does not constitute residency in that county.
You must decide which county you consider “home.” If you plan to live in your home county after college, then list your parents’ address as your residence. If you do NOT intend to return there, you may list your college address as your residence. Remember: you must keep your address CURRENT on your voter registration. That’s one reason college students often list their parents’ address, which may not change as often.
