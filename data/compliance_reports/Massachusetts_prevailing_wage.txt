Covered Employers
The Massachusetts prevailing wage laws require that covered employees on public works projects be paid a minimum hourly rate set by the [Department of Labor Standards](https://www.mass.gov/prevailing-wage-program) (DLS). The prevailing wage laws apply to both union and non-union employers and employees. The Attorney General's Office (AGO) enforces these laws.
Employers are limited in the deductions that may be made from the hourly rate “total rate” on the wage rate schedules.
If an employer contributes to any, or all, of the above plans, it may deduct the hourly amount contributed from the “total rate.” If the employer does not contribute to any of the benefit plans listed above, then the employee’s hourly rate of pay will be the “total rate” from the wage rate schedule.

Covered Employees

- It is the awarding authority’s (city, town, county, district, state agency, or authority) responsibility to ensure that a copy of the prevailing wage rate schedule is provided to all contractors from whom bids or quotes are sought. DLS will not issue original wage rate schedules directly to contractors or employees.
In Massachusetts, all workers are presumed to be employees. (Please seethe Attorney General’s [Advisory on the Massachusetts Independent Contractor/Misclassification Law](https://www.mass.gov/doc/attorney-generals-advisory-on-the-independent-contractor-law/download) for more information.) Prevailing wages must be paid to covered employees on public works projects regardless of whether they are employed by the general contractor, a filed sub-bidder, or any sub-contractor.

What Should Employers Do?
The Massachusetts prevailing wage laws require that covered employees on public works projects be paid a minimum hourly rate set by the [Department of Labor Standards](https://www.mass.gov/prevailing-wage-program) (DLS). The prevailing wage laws apply to both union and non-union employers and employees. The Attorney General's Office (AGO) enforces these laws.
DLS issues the required rates for each public construction project and determines which rates apply to which classifications. This is called the "prevailing wage rate schedule." Prevailing wage rate schedules are set by DLS based upon the rates established in local collective bargaining contracts. DLS also determines whether the prevailing wage applies to a given public works project.
- It is the awarding authority’s (city, town, county, district, state agency, or authority) responsibility to ensure that a copy of the prevailing wage rate schedule is provided to all contractors from whom bids or quotes are sought. DLS will not issue original wage rate schedules directly to contractors or employees.
- Once a wage rate scheduled has been issued for a project by DLS, it will remain in effect for the duration of the project, except in the case of multi-year public construction projects. For construction projects lasting longer than one year, awarding authorities must request an updated wage schedule no later than two weeks before the anniversary of the date the contract was executed by the awarding authority and the general contractor. For multi-year CM AT RISK projects, the awarding authority must request an annual update no later than two weeks before the anniversary date, determined as the earlier of: (a) the execution date of the GMP Amendment, or (b) the execution date of the first amendment to permit procurement of construction services.  The updated wage schedule must be provided to all contractors, including general and sub-contractors, working on the construction project.

Training Requirements
## OSHA construction 10-hour training
All covered employees who are entitled to receive the prevailing wage while on the worksite, as well as any other employee of an entity that is required to pay the prevailing wage at the worksite, must have completed the OSHA 10 training. Contractors must provide documentation of the OSHA 10 training on the CPR for each employee the first time the individual is listed on a weekly payroll record. All covered employees must carry documentation of OSHA 10 training on their person when they are on the worksite or be able to immediately direct a representative of the AGO to the documentation. See AGO's [OSHA 10 Advisory](https://www.mass.gov/doc/advisory-on-the-osha-10-act/download).

Training Deadlines
Not specified in available documentation

Qualified Trainers
## Certified payroll records
Contractors are required to submit weekly payroll reports directly to the awarding authority and keep them on file for three years. These weekly payroll reports are commonly known as " _certified payroll records_" (CPRs). Each report must contain at least the employee’s name, address, occupational classification, hours worked, and wages paid. A sample [_Weekly Certified Payroll Report Form_](https://www.mass.gov/doc/massachusetts-weekly-certified-payroll-report-form-0/download) is available from DLS. A completed [Weekly Statement of Compliance Form](https://www.mass.gov/doc/weekly-statement-of-compliance/download), as well as copies of apprentice ID cards for any employees being paid the apprentice rate, must accompany each submitted _weekly payroll report_.

Special Requirements
- This annual update requirement is generally not applicable to 27F “rental of equipment” contracts.  For such contracts, the prevailing wage rates issued by DLS shall remain in effect for the duration of the contract term.  However, if the prevailing wage rate sheet issued does not contain wage rates for each year covered by the contract term, the Awarding Authority must request updated rate sheets from DLS and provide them to the contractor to ensure the correct rates are being paid throughout the duration of the contract.  Awarding authorities should request these updates from DLS no later than two weeks before the start of the first year covered by the contract that does not have wage rates set.  For example, if a town enters into a five-year contract for trash/recycling services that covers 2025-2030, but the original prevailing wage rate sheet issued only contains wage rates for 2025 and 2026, the town must request updated rates at least two weeks before the start of the 2027 contract year.  Additionally, if an Awarding Authority exercises an option to renew or extend the contract term, they must request updated rate sheets from DLS and provide them to the contractor.
All employees who perform work on a public works project must be paid the rate per hour according to the schedule issued for the particular project. If you are unsure which rate to pay an employee for any particular work, you must contact DLS at (617) 626-6953 for guidance.
All wage increases listed on the wage rate schedule, if any, must be paid effective the specific dates listed.
