Request _REV–634, Employee Fringe Benefits and Wage/Salary Supplements_. | Payments, not representing regular wages, including payments made by third party insurers for sickness or disability, are not taxable income for Pennsylvania purposes. Your employer should not include periodic payments for sickness or disability in Box 16 of your federal FormW–2. If your employer includes this income and withholds Pennsylvania tax, you must obtain and submit a corrected federal FormW–2 or a statement from your employer explaining the error. |

If the course, degree program, or training is designed to enable the employee to enter a new field or profession or to obtain a promotion, the reimbursement is taxable. | If employer reimburses employees for education cost, then the reimbursement is fully taxable and the employee may deduct only those amounts directly related to business expenses allowed on PA-40 Schedule UE, Allowable Employee Business Expenses, to determine taxable compensation. | Employees of an institution of higher learning that receive free or low–cost education receive the tuition assistance tax free for Pennsylvania personal income tax purposes unless they receive cash grants (for themselves or their children) as reimbursements for the tuition paid at their institution of employment or any other institution of higher learning. Since Pennsylvania personal income tax has no distinction regarding taxability with respect to the amount of the benefits received for highly compensated employees, these benefits would also be considered tax free for Pennsylvania personal income tax purposes unless a cash grant is received. |
