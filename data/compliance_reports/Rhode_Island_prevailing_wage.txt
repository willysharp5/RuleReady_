Rhode Island Prevailing Wage Laws (public contracts)

Overview
**Prevailing Wage** refers to the requirements of the [Rhode Island General Law 37-13](https://webserver.rilegislature.gov/Statutes/TITLE37/37-13/INDEX.HTM) and the general prevailing rate of pay for regular, holiday and overtime wages to be paid to each craftsman, mechanic, teamster, laborer or other type of worker performing work on public works projects when state or municipal funds are used in excess of $1,000. Contractors must refer to the applicable [Davis Bacon Wage Determination](https://sam.gov/content/wage-determinations) rate schedule found online at the U.S. System for Award Management (SAM) to determine the prevailing wage rates for a public works construction project. The prevailing wage rates to be applied are those that are effective as of the date of the awarding of the contract to the general contractor. Contractors must also adjust employees' hourly wage rates (if applicable) every July 1st in accordance with any updated Davis Bacon Wage Determination rates.
The Prevailing Wage Section has been actively conducting compliance investigations on Prevailing Wage projects as well as through various Awarding Authorities throughout the state. Any violation of [RIGL 37-13-13](https://webserver.rilegislature.gov/Statutes/TITLE37/37-13/37-13-13.htm) of Certified Weekly Payroll Forms and Daily Logs will result in the department imposing a penalty on the contractor of a minimum of one hundred dollars ($100) for each calendar day of noncompliance.

Covered Employers
Every contractor/subcontractor awarded a contract for public works shall submit completed RI Certified Weekly Payroll forms listing all employees working on the job-site to the awarding authority on a monthly basis for all work completed in the preceding month. Substituting this form with company payroll forms, or other state or federal forms is not acceptable. Certified Payroll forms concerning RI Dept. of Transportation funded projects may be submitted on federal forms, but if a complaint is being investigated by the RI Dept. of Labor and Training (DLT), the contractor must resubmit the payroll information on the RI Certified Weekly Payroll forms for the entire project. Awarding authorities, contractors and subcontractors shall provide all payroll records to the DLT within 10 days of any request made by the department.
