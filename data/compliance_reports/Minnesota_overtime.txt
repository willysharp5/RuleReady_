Reciprocity/Extraterritorial Coverage
Overtime is to be paid at one-and-one-half times the regular rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of 48 hours in a seven-day workweek, under state law. However, most businesses are subject to the [federal Fair Labor Standards Act](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/flsa) that requires overtime after 40 hours in a seven-day workweek. No employer or employee may enter into an agreement that would violate the law requiring an employee to be paid overtime. (See [Minnesota Statutes 177.25](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/?id=177.25).)

You may contact the clerk of the bankruptcy court to file a preferred wage claim if there are concerns that sufficient funds will not be available to cover your wages as a creditor. Major stockholders, owners and officers of a bankrupt business may be personally liable.
