Training Requirements
- **Training**: Time spent in training that is required by the employer.
- **9:00 AM – 12:00 PM**. Hospital training session **(3 hours)**.
In contrast to an “independent contractor,” generally employees are individuals who regularly performwork within that employer’s ordinary course of business. Workers are not independent contractors simply because they work offsite, or work remotely, or have flexibility over their hours and responsibilities.

Training Deadlines
- **Salaried Employees:** Salaried Employees are entitled to receive a salary that is equal to or greater than the amount they would receive if paid hourly at the minimum wage rate.  Employers must also pay overtime on hours worked over 40 hours a week ( [see below](http://oag.dc.gov/oag.dc.gov#Overtime)) unless a worker’s job function fits within a [specific exemption](https://code.dccouncil.gov/us/dc/council/code/sections/32-1004).
**The D.C. tipped minimum wage is being phased out over time.** In November 2022, Ballot Initiative 82, or the “District of Columbia Tip Credit Elimination Act,” was passed by District voters. Under this law, the tipped minimum wage will increase annually until 2027, when it will become the full minimum wage. During the transition period, employers must continue to comply with all of the above requirements. After this change, the law will still require that employees keep all tips they receive, in addition to the minimum wage.
| **If your employer has this many employees:** | **Then you earn one hour of accrued paid sick leave per this number of hours worked:** | **Up to a maximum of this many days per year:** |

Coverage Election
An independent contractor is engaged by a company or a person to perform a certain service. Generally, independent contractors are self-employed businesspeople who offer specialized skills and perform a service that is not part of the company’s overall business. True independent contractors have the ability to set their job duties, hours, and wages, as well as select their own customers. They are responsible for paying their own taxes and have to get their own insurance in order to be protected if they are injured on the job or become unemployed. Independent contractors receive a Form 1099 for paying their federal taxes, while employees receive a Form W-2.
In 2018, OAG worked with the D.C. Council on legislation that grants OAG independent authority to investigate and bring wage theft cases, including misclassification cases. Since gaining independent authority, OAG has launched more than 40 investigations into wage theft and payroll fraud. In 2020, [OAG secured it’s largest wage theft settlement to date](https://oag.dc.gov/release/ag-racine-announces-national-electrical-contractor), requiring Power Design—a major electrical contractor—to pay $2.75 million to hundreds of harmed workers and the District over wage theft and worker misclassification claims. [OAG also resolved a case against Capitol Drywall, Inc.](https://oag.dc.gov/release/ag-racine-announces-capitol-drywall-must-pay-200k)—a Maryland construction company—penalizing them $200K for cheating 100+ District workers out of wages and benefits by misclassifying them as Independent Contractors.
