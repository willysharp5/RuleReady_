Mississippi Workplace Safety Requirements (OSHA or state-level)

Overview
[OSHA mandates training on certain topics](https://www.osha.gov/Publications/osha2254.pdf) throughout the country, but in Mississippi, its 10- and 30-Hour Outreach courses aren’t required. However, you’re not excused from all training! Even when Outreach training isn’t required by law, many Mississippi employers will still require it as part of their onboarding training. For context, [OSHA 10-hour courses](https://www.360training.com/osha-campus/osha-10-hour-online) are designed for entry-level workers, and [OSHA 30-hour courses](https://www.360training.com/osha-campus/osha-30-hour-online) are designed for supervisors.
OSHA’s main goal is to prevent workplace injuries and fatalities through quality training and employee awareness, but their training doesn’t just benefit employees. In fact, when Mississippi employers invest in OSHA training, they have the opportunity to avoid OSHA inspection penalties, lower worker compensation costs, and increase worker productivity.

As you just saw, Mississippi workers, especially those in construction, are at a high-risk of injuries and fatalities. Employers can also be hit from lack of OSHA compliance, but from a financial perspective with heavy fines.

Covered Employees
