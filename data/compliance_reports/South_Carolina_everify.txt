South Carolina E-Verify / Employment Verification

Overview
"The Employer agrees that it will use the information it receives from SSA or DHS pursuant to E-Verify and this MOU only to confirm the employment eligibility of employees as authorized by this MOU. The Employer agrees that it will safeguard this information, and means of access to it (such as PINS and passwords) to ensure that it is not used for any other purpose and as necessary to protect its confidentiality, including ensuring that it is not disseminated to any person other than employees of the Employer who are authorized to perform the Employer's responsibilities under this MOU, except for such dissemination as may be authorized in advance by SSA or DHS for legitimate purposes."
DHS has determined that the South Carolina Department of Labor, Licensing, and Regulation's audits of employers using the E-Verify system constitute such a legitimate purpose. Therefore, South Carolina Employers and their E-Verify Employer Agents can now release E-Verify information, respective to their own, internal employees, in response to an inquiry from an LLR official.

However, if your company uses an E-Verify Employer Agent (EEA), ask your Agent to provide you a paper copy or electronic copy of this report.
