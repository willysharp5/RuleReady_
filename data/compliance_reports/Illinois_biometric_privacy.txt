For example, social security numbers, when compromised, can be changed. Biometrics, however, are biologically unique to the individual; therefore, once compromised, the individual has no recourse, is at heightened risk for identity theft, and is likely to withdraw from biometric-facilitated transactions.` `    ``(d) An overwhelming majority of members of the public are weary of the use of biometrics when such information is tied to finances and other personal information.` `    ``(e) Despite limited State law regulating the collection, use, safeguarding, and storage of biometrics, many members of the public are deterred from partaking in biometric identifier-facilitated transactions.` `    ``(f) The full ramifications of biometric technology are not fully known.` `    ``(g) The public welfare, security, and safety will be served by regulating the collection, use, safeguarding, handling, storage, retention, and destruction of biometric identifiers and information. ` `` `(Source: P.A. 95-994, eff. 10-3-08.)` |

Updating the database of the Illinois Compiled Statutes (ILCS) is an ongoing process. Recent laws may not yet be included in the ILCS database, but they are found on this site as [Public Acts](https://ilga.gov/legislation/publicacts/default.asp) soon after they become law. For information concerning the relationship between statutes and Public Acts, refer to the [Guide](https://ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/using.asp).

Information maintained by the Legislative Reference Bureau
Because the statute database is maintained primarily for legislative drafting purposes, statutory changes are sometimes included in the statute database before they take effect. If the source note at the end of a Section of the statutes includes a Public Act that has not yet taken effect, the version of the law that is currently in effect may have already been removed from the database and you should refer to that Public Act to see the changes made to the current law.
