What Should Employers Do?
Employers are required to allow workers to take leave to serve jury duty.
Employers cannot terminate or retaliate against a worker for fulfilling the important societal obligation of serving jury duty.
I just got a summons to jury duty next month. It is a critical time for my employer as seasonal business. Is there a hardship exemption that we could claim? Can my employer require me to defer jury service?
There are a couple of points to keep in mind, however. The court must balance the public need for juries against the individual circumstances offered as a justification for excuse from jury service, and a request for excusal does not mean the court will necessarily grant that excusal. Your employer may not discharge or retaliate against you if you choose to perform jury service.

Special Requirements
There are different requirements for exempt salaried employees. In order for these employees to remain exempt, they must receive their full salary for any work week in which work is performed. Absence for jury duty is not one of the specific reasons for which an employer may reduce an exempt employee’s salary.
Employers should note that while they may not make salary deductions for absences of a salaried exempt employee caused by jury duty, the employer may offset any amounts received by an employee as jury fees for a particular week against the salary due for that particular week without loss of the exemption. 29 C.F.R. §541.602(b)(3).
However, under wage and hour law there are different requirements for exempt salaried employees. In order for these employees to remain exempt, they must receive their full salary for any work week in which work is performed. Absence for jury duty is not one of the specific reasons for which an employer may reduce an exempt employee’s salary.

Coverage Election
There are a couple of points to keep in mind, however. The court must balance the public need for juries against the individual circumstances offered as a justification for excuse from jury service, and a request for excusal does not mean the court will necessarily grant that excusal. Your employer may not discharge or retaliate against you if you choose to perform jury service.
- Example 1: A salaried exempt employee has been subpoenaed for jury duty for two weeks. The employee reports to the court house as required every day and is not selected to serve. Every day the employee is dismissed by the administrator of the court at about noon and returns to work. In this example, this salaried exempt employee must receive the full salary for the two weeks of jury duty.

Penalties for Non-Compliance
Employers of 10 or more employees are required to continue health, disability, life or other insurance coverage for an employee during times when the employee serves or is scheduled to serve as a juror. There is a small-employer exemption, and these requirements do not apply for employers with nine or fewer employees. The continuation of health, disability, life or other insurance coverage would be up to a small employer’s benefits policy to define when and how an employee qualifies for coverage and under what circumstances that coverage will be discontinued.
