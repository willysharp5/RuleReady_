Overview
[Skip to main content](https://www.labor.nc.gov/standards-information-and-activity#main-content)
With certain exceptions, the N.C. Department of Labor adopts federal OSHA standards verbatim within six months of federal promulgation and uses the standards for enforcement of the N.C. Occupational Safety and Health Act. To stay informed of upcoming rules that may affect North Carolina, you may access the U.S. Department of Labor (USDOL) [agency rules](https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/eAgendaMain?operation=OPERATION_GET_AGENCY_RULE_LIST&currentPub=true&agencyCode=&showStage=active&agencyCd=1200&Image58_x=38&Image58_y=14&Image58=Submit) that are in various stages of the rulemaking process; pre-rule, proposed rule, and final rule stage. The USDOL follows a specific [rulemaking process](https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/rulemakingprocess) when federal OSHA decides that regulatory action for adoption of a new standard is necessary. USDOL/OSHA develops and publishes the proposed rule in the [Federal Register](https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/federalregister/publicationdate/currentyear) and [solicit comments](https://www.regulations.gov/search?agencyIds=OSHA&withinCommentPeriod=true) from the public across the country, including North Carolina. After federal OSHA considers the feedback from the public, they make changes where appropriate, and then publish a final rule in the Federal Register with the date the rule becomes effective. In issuing a final rule, the USDOL/OSHA will describe and respond to the public comments in the Federal Register.
