Overview
**The PWFA went into effect on June 27, 2023. On April 15, 2024 the EEOC issued its final regulation to carry out the law. The final** [**regulation**](https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2024-07527) **went into effect on June 18, 2024.**
1. **What is the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act?**

Covered Employers
Generally, the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (PWFA) requires a covered employer to provide a “reasonable accommodation” to a qualified employee’s or applicant’s known limitations related to, affected by, or arising out of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions, unless the accommodation will cause the employer an “undue hardship.”
The PWFA does not replace federal, state, or local laws that are **more protective** of workers (used here to mean job applicants and employees) affected by pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions. More than 30 [states](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/wb/pregnant-nursing-employment-protections) and cities have laws that require employers to provide accommodations for pregnant workers.
4. **Which employers does the PWFA apply to?**

Covered Employees
1. **What is the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act?**
Generally, the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (PWFA) requires a covered employer to provide a “reasonable accommodation” to a qualified employee’s or applicant’s known limitations related to, affected by, or arising out of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions, unless the accommodation will cause the employer an “undue hardship.”
The PWFA applies only to accommodations. Other [laws](https://www.eeoc.gov/pregnancy-discrimination) that the EEOC enforces make it illegal to fire or otherwise discriminate against employees or applicants on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions.

What Should Employers Do?
Generally, the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (PWFA) requires a covered employer to provide a “reasonable accommodation” to a qualified employee’s or applicant’s known limitations related to, affected by, or arising out of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions, unless the accommodation will cause the employer an “undue hardship.”
The PWFA does not replace federal, state, or local laws that are **more protective** of workers (used here to mean job applicants and employees) affected by pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions. More than 30 [states](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/wb/pregnant-nursing-employment-protections) and cities have laws that require employers to provide accommodations for pregnant workers.
Covered employers must not:
- Require an employee to accept an accommodation other than a reasonable accommodation arrived at through the interactive process;

Training Requirements
Not specified in available documentation

Training Deadlines
- The employer would not ask an employee for documentation in that situation normally. If an employer’s policy is that employees only need a note from a health care provider for absences if they are missing 3 or more days in a row, the employer can’t require someone who needs a reasonable accommodation of 1 day off because of pregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical condition to provide information from the health care provider.
- Describes the adjustment or change at work that is needed due to the limitation (for example, no lifting more than 20 pounds for 3 months, the approximate number and frequency of health care appointments, the estimated time off for recovery, additional safety gear, work functions that should be suspended and for how long, or a later start time).

Qualified Trainers
Generally, the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (PWFA) requires a covered employer to provide a “reasonable accommodation” to a qualified employee’s or applicant’s known limitations related to, affected by, or arising out of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions, unless the accommodation will cause the employer an “undue hardship.”
The PWFA provides for reasonable accommodations for qualified applicants or employees who have known limitations. Under the PWFA, “limitations” are physical or mental conditions related to, affected by, or arising out of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions.

Special Requirements
- Additional, longer, or more flexible breaks to drink water, eat, rest, or use the restroom;
- Train supervisors about the PWFA. First level supervisors may be particularly likely to receive accommodation requests and should be trained about how to respond, including how to avoid retaliating against those who request or use a reasonable accommodation.
- Workers do not need to use specific words to request an accommodation to begin the interactive process. Once an employee requests an accommodation, use the interactive process.

Coverage Election
Although an employer is not required to seek medical information from an employee’s health care provider, the employer may seek information from the employee’s health care provider under limited circumstances. An employer may not require that the employee seeking the accommodation be examined by a health care provider selected by the employer.

Reciprocity/Extraterritorial Coverage
The PWFA does not replace federal, state, or local laws that are **more protective** of workers (used here to mean job applicants and employees) affected by pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions. More than 30 [states](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/wb/pregnant-nursing-employment-protections) and cities have laws that require employers to provide accommodations for pregnant workers.
The PWFA applies to private employers and public sector employers (state and local governments) that have 15 or more employees. It also applies to Congress and Federal agencies, and to employment agencies and labor organizations.

Employer Responsibilities & Deadlines

Although an employer is not required to seek medical information from an employee’s health care provider, the employer may seek information from the employee’s health care provider under limited circumstances. An employer may not require that the employee seeking the accommodation be examined by a health care provider selected by the employer.
First, seeking documentation must be reasonable under the circumstances for the employer. It is not reasonable if:
- The limitation and need for an adjustment or change at work due to the limitation is obvious. For example, an obviously pregnant employee who seeks a bigger uniform because of their pregnancy cannot be required to provide additional information.

Employer Notification Requirements
The Commission expects that many PWFA accommodations can be granted after simple exchanges of information between employees or applicants and employers, such as brief conversations or emails.
9. **Can employers require that the employee or applicant provide information from the employee’s health care provider about the limitation?**
In many instances under the PWFA, a discussion with the applicant or employee may be sufficient and supporting documentation will not be needed. Employers also should keep in mind that it may be difficult for a worker to obtain information from a health care professional early in pregnancy.

Pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions” includes uncomplicated pregnancies, vaginal deliveries or cesarian sections, miscarriage, postpartum depression, edema, placenta previa, and lactation. There are more examples in the regulation at [https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2024-07527](https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2024-07527).

Recordkeeping Requirements
