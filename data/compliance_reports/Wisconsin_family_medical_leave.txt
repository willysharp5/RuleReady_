The employer keeps the account. The premium amount can be paid by the employee at regular intervals over a period of 12 months or longer. The employer must return the amount placed in escrow plus interest to the employee when he or she terminates employment with that employer.

Special Requirements
An employee may be covered under both laws. Federal law may provide additional protection.
Example: Following the birth of a child, mother desires to take off 12 weeks and father six weeks. Mother will be on leave for her own serious health condition for a period of six weeks, under her employer's disability plan, concurrently using two weeks of Wisconsin leave for her serious health condition and six weeks of federal leave for her serious health condition. At the end of the six weeks of disability, she may take an additional six weeks of leave for the birth of the child under Wisconsin law, concurrently utilizing the remaining six weeks of her federal leave. The father will take six weeks of leave for the birth of a child. Concurrently using his six weeks for the birth of a child under Wisconsin law and six weeks of his federal entitlement, leaving six weeks of leave under the federal law which may be used for other qualifying purposes later in the year
Example: The child of an employee experiences a serious health condition, which has a duration of 12 weeks. The first two weeks are covered by both laws with the next 10 weeks of leave covered only by federal law. If the employee's need for leave should extend beyond 12 weeks, the availability of additional weeks will be governed by the employer's leave policies.

Employee may not substitute paid sick leave, medical, or family leave for any situation not covered by employer's leave plan. | Employee may elect to substitute accrued paid or unpaid leave of any other type provided by employer. | Wisconsin |

Reciprocity/Extraterritorial Coverage
Family Medical Leave is a benefit available by state law to certain employees. The Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) provides unpaid leave for an employee's serious health condition, the serious health condition of a parent, child or spouse, or for the birth or adoption of a child. A covered employer has at least 50 permanent employees during at least 6 of the last 12 months. Covered employees have worked for the employer for at least 52 consecutive weeks and for at least 1000 hours in the preceding 52 week period.
An employee must qualify under the federal law to be entitled to the 12 weeks of leave. The employee must qualify under Wisconsin law to be eligible for the Wisconsin leave entitlement. Satisfaction of one law's eligibility requirements does not necessarily mean the employee has satisfied the requirements of the other. However, an employer may use the lower of the federal and state requirements for purposes of leave administration. In such a case, the satisfaction of the lower thresholds for federal and Wisconsin leave will result in employee entitlement to such leaves.

Employer Responsibilities & Deadlines
## What is required of employers?
- An employer must permit the employee to take up to 2 weeks of leave for their own serious health condition in a calendar year, up to 2 weeks for the serious health condition of a parent, child or spouse, and up to 6 weeks for the birth or adoption of a child. This leave may be taken as needed in blocks or intermittently as needed by the employee.
- During the leave, the employee's health insurance must be continued under the same conditions as prior to leave.

Employer Notification Requirements
### If an employee is entitled to leave under both laws, which requirements for notice, certification, substitution and intermittent leave apply?
Nothing in the Federal Family and Medical Leave Act supersedes any provision of state or local law which provides greater family and medical leave rights than those provided by the federal law. Therefore, where an employee is entitled to leave under both laws, the notice, certification, substitution and intermittent leave requirements which provide the greater leave rights apply. However, if an employee's leave extends beyond the period of coverage under one of the laws, an employer may require the employee to comply with the requirements of the continuing law.
### If an employee is entitled to leave under only Wisconsin law, what rules apply as to notice, certification and intermittent leave.

Posting Requirements
### If an employee is entitled to leave under both laws, which requirements for notice, certification, substitution and intermittent leave apply?
Nothing in the Federal Family and Medical Leave Act supersedes any provision of state or local law which provides greater family and medical leave rights than those provided by the federal law. Therefore, where an employee is entitled to leave under both laws, the notice, certification, substitution and intermittent leave requirements which provide the greater leave rights apply. However, if an employee's leave extends beyond the period of coverage under one of the laws, an employer may require the employee to comply with the requirements of the continuing law.
### If an employee is entitled to leave under only Wisconsin law, what rules apply as to notice, certification and intermittent leave.

Recordkeeping Requirements
The employer must maintain the same group health insurance coverage for the employee during the leave as existed prior to the leave. The same conditions must apply to coverage during the leave that applied before the leave. (For Example: If an employee contributed part of the health insurance premium, this same arrangement will continue for coverage during the leave. If the employer contributed the entire premium, that must also be the case during the leave.)
If health insurance coverage is provided, the employer may require that the employee pay the full premium for eight (8) weeks of coverage into an interest-bearing escrow account in a financial institution. The employer keeps the account. The premium amount can be paid by the employee at regular intervals over a period of 12 months or longer. The employer must return the amount placed in escrow plus interest to the employee when he or she terminates employment with that employer.
