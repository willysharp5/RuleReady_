Covered Employers
These instructions are to assist Virginia employers who have received court or administrative orders requiring the employer to withhold and send wages to satisfy an employee’s debt. These orders should be obeyed in every detail; failure to obey may be grounds for contempt of court. [**Section 34-29(c) of the Code of Virginia (1950)**](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/34-29/)as amended, however, limits the amounts which may be withheld and provides: “No court of the Commonwealth and no state agency or officer may make, execute, or enforce any order or process in violation of this section”.
Always be sure calculations of protected amounts are based on the current Virginia minimum wage rate. No employer may discharge any employee by reason of the fact that his earnings have been subjected to garnishment for any one indebtedness [**Code of Virginia, Sec. 34-29(f).**](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/34-29/)
Virginia is an employment-at-will state; this means the employer may terminate any employee at any time, for any reason, or for no reason. As a general rule, therefore, the employee has no right to challenge the termination. There are a few very limited exceptions. For example, an employee may not be discriminated against or terminated because he has filed a safety complaint or exercised his rights under OSHA law. [**Virginia Code § 40.1-51.2:1.**](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/40.1-51.2:1/) Also, federal law protects employees from discrimination because of age, race, sex, religion, national origin or handicap.
