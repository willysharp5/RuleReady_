The bill allows an employee to take leave to vote, register to vote, obtain a ballot or replacement ballot, or obtain documents or identification necessary to vote or register. For a general, primary, or coordinated election, the bill allows an employee to take the leave one time on any day that polling locations are open. For all other elections, the bill allows the employee to take the leave one time on any day during the 8 days prior to and including the day of the election.
