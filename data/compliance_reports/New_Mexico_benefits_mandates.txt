New Mexico Employee Benefits Mandates (like state retirement savings programs)

Overview
2024 Update In 2020, House Bill 44, sponsored by Sen. Bill Tallman, Sen. Michael Padilla, Rep. Tomás Salazar, Rep. Christine Chandler, and Rep. Gail Armstrong, passed in the legislature and was signed into law by Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham. This legislation created the non-compensated New Mexico Work and Save Board which gives them powers and duties; allows for a voluntary savings program for private-sector employees, nonprofit employees, and self-employed individuals via a Roth Individual Retirement Account; allows for a web-based “retail” Retirement Savings Plan Marketplace; provides protection for covered employers; provides for confidentiality of participants and account information; and requires annual reports. The program is voluntary for both employers and employees. A Request For Proposal was created during the previous administration, but no one expressed interest. It was later stated that in order for the program to be successful, it needed to be mandated to require all business to participate with the option to opt out. Legislation was proposed in 2022 and 2023 to require specific employers to register as participating employers, automatically enrolling their employees in the New Mexico Work and Save IRA Program and allowing employees to opt out of automatic enrollment. That legislation did not move forward. There was also legislation introduced to remove Work and Save from the Treasurer’s Office. That legislation did not move forward either. Therefore, the New Mexico Work and Save program is not currently operational and has been delayed. Overview When it comes to saving for retirement:

Covered Employers
2024 Update In 2020, House Bill 44, sponsored by Sen. Bill Tallman, Sen. Michael Padilla, Rep. Tomás Salazar, Rep. Christine Chandler, and Rep. Gail Armstrong, passed in the legislature and was signed into law by Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham. This legislation created the non-compensated New Mexico Work and Save Board which gives them powers and duties; allows for a voluntary savings program for private-sector employees, nonprofit employees, and self-employed individuals via a Roth Individual Retirement Account; allows for a web-based “retail” Retirement Savings Plan Marketplace; provides protection for covered employers; provides for confidentiality of participants and account information; and requires annual reports. The program is voluntary for both employers and employees. A Request For Proposal was created during the previous administration, but no one expressed interest. It was later stated that in order for the program to be successful, it needed to be mandated to require all business to participate with the option to opt out. Legislation was proposed in 2022 and 2023 to require specific employers to register as participating employers, automatically enrolling their employees in the New Mexico Work and Save IRA Program and allowing employees to opt out of automatic enrollment. That legislation did not move forward. There was also legislation introduced to remove Work and Save from the Treasurer’s Office. That legislation did not move forward either. Therefore, the New Mexico Work and Save program is not currently operational and has been delayed. Overview When it comes to saving for retirement:
62% of private-sector New Mexico workers age 18 to 64 work for businesses that do not offer a retirement plan.
Social Security benefits average only about $1,160 per month in New Mexico, so many workers rely on employer-sponsored retirement plans to supplement their income as they age.

In 2020, House Bill 44, sponsored by Sen. Bill Tallman and Rep. Tomás Salazar, along with Rep. Christine Chandler, Rep. Gail Armstrong, and Sen.

The program is voluntary for both employers and employees. Another component of the New Mexico Saves Act is financial education for both employees and employers. You can read that legislation here. https://nmlegis.gov/Sessions/20%20Regular/final/HB0044.pdf In the 2021 Legislative Session, Sen. Tallman carried Senate Bill 129, which was enacted.

2024 Update In 2020, House Bill 44, sponsored by Sen. Bill Tallman, Sen. Michael Padilla, Rep. Tomás Salazar, Rep. Christine Chandler, and Rep. Gail Armstrong, passed in the legislature and was signed into law by Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham. This legislation created the non-compensated New Mexico Work and Save Board which gives them powers and duties; allows for a voluntary savings program for private-sector employees, nonprofit employees, and self-employed individuals via a Roth Individual Retirement Account; allows for a web-based “retail” Retirement Savings Plan Marketplace; provides protection for covered employers; provides for confidentiality of participants and account information; and requires annual reports. The program is voluntary for both employers and employees. A Request For Proposal was created during the previous administration, but no one expressed interest. It was later stated that in order for the program to be successful, it needed to be mandated to require all business to participate with the option to opt out. Legislation was proposed in 2022 and 2023 to require specific employers to register as participating employers, automatically enrolling their employees in the New Mexico Work and Save IRA Program and allowing employees to opt out of automatic enrollment. That legislation did not move forward. There was also legislation introduced to remove Work and Save from the Treasurer’s Office. That legislation did not move forward either. Therefore, the New Mexico Work and Save program is not currently operational and has been delayed. Overview When it comes to saving for retirement:

Reciprocity/Extraterritorial Coverage
2024 Update In 2020, House Bill 44, sponsored by Sen. Bill Tallman, Sen. Michael Padilla, Rep. Tomás Salazar, Rep. Christine Chandler, and Rep. Gail Armstrong, passed in the legislature and was signed into law by Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham. This legislation created the non-compensated New Mexico Work and Save Board which gives them powers and duties; allows for a voluntary savings program for private-sector employees, nonprofit employees, and self-employed individuals via a Roth Individual Retirement Account; allows for a web-based “retail” Retirement Savings Plan Marketplace; provides protection for covered employers; provides for confidentiality of participants and account information; and requires annual reports. The program is voluntary for both employers and employees. A Request For Proposal was created during the previous administration, but no one expressed interest. It was later stated that in order for the program to be successful, it needed to be mandated to require all business to participate with the option to opt out. Legislation was proposed in 2022 and 2023 to require specific employers to register as participating employers, automatically enrolling their employees in the New Mexico Work and Save IRA Program and allowing employees to opt out of automatic enrollment. That legislation did not move forward. There was also legislation introduced to remove Work and Save from the Treasurer’s Office. That legislation did not move forward either. Therefore, the New Mexico Work and Save program is not currently operational and has been delayed. Overview When it comes to saving for retirement:
