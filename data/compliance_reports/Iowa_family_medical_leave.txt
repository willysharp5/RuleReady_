# FMLA (Family & Medical Leave Act)

Covered Employers
The [Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fmla) is a federally mandated program that entitles eligible employees of covered employers to un-paid, job-protected leave for specified family, medical and military reasons with continuation of group health insurance coverage under the same terms and conditions as if the employee had not taken leave. Eligible State of Iowa employees are entitled to up to 12 work weeks of FMLA leave in a fiscal year (up to 26 weeks for Military Caregiver Leave in a single 12-month period).
- You must request and report all absences via the Workday Absence Calendar prior to the end of the pay period in which they fall and preferably within 2 business days of the absence.
