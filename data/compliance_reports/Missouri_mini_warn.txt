What Should Employers Do?
If an employer plans to reduce its force or close a worksite, it must provide notice under the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN Act), 29 U.S.C §2101 et seq.  The WARN Act provides protection to workers, their families, and communities by requiring employers to provide a 60-calendar day notice in advance of covered plant closings and mass layoffs. Employers are encouraged to give workers notice even when WARN does not require it and to work with state and local agencies to help workers access helpful transition services.
In general, OWD prefers the employer provide WARN notices to the State WARN Coordinator and the Chief Local Elected Official (CLEO) of the local government where the layoff will occur 60 days before the first layoff date. A WARN notice must include, but is not limited to:
