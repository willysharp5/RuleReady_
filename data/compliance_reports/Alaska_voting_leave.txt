Alaska Voting / Civic Leave

Overview
Absentee In-Person and Early Voting locations are open for voting starting 15 days prior and through Election Day. Each location has different hours and district ballots available.   Absentee In-Person voting requires you to complete an envelope with your voted ballot and drop the envelope in a ballot box. These ballots are not scanned at the voting location and are instead reviewed by the Absentee Review Board to make sure you are eligible and that you have not already voted. At locations that are marked as an Early Voting location, your eligibility is determined at the time you vote by verifying that the information on your voter registration record is current. If everything is correct, you will vote your ballot and insert it into scanner. If your information is not current, you will have to vote using the Absentee In-Person method.

Absentee In-Person voting is like voting early at your polling place. The difference is that absentee locations do not have a secure connection with the voter registration database system, which means the poll worker cannot look you up to verify your information.
