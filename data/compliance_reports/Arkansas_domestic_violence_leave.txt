Covered Employees
The Attorney General’s Office administers the Crime Victims Reparations Program and the Sexual Assault Program. The Arkansas Legislature created the “Arkansas Crime Victims Reparations Act” with Act 817 in 1987. The legislation provides a method for compensating and providing assistance to victims and their dependents that have suffered personal injury or death as the result of a violent crime, including DWI and hit and run accidents. The administrative staff, consisting of the Administrator, staff attorney, and six full-time investigators, is responsible for investigating the claim and making recommendations to the Board on decisions pertaining to awarding or denying claims.
The Commission’s purpose and membership is defined in Act 1336, passed by the state legislature in 1995. Commission membership is comprised of community leaders throughout the state appointed by the Governor. This comprehensive group is made up of 27 representatives from various agencies, professions or groups, and service providers including law enforcement, medicine, and mental health. They seek to provide training, proven prevention practices, public awareness, resource development, and technical assistance to service providers, decision-makers, professionals, and concerned citizens. The Commission’s subcommittees are dedicated to research and projects focusing on community education, victim services training, and justice issues. Meetings are open to the public and the staff is available for training, technical assistance, consultation, policy analysis, and speaking engagements.

What Should Employers Do?
When a crime occurs, law enforcement officers are normally the first to respond. These officers may need to provide protection and assistance to persons with physical injuries and/or emotional trauma. Emergency services, such as ambulances and fire department response teams, may be required. Depending on the size of the law enforcement agency, the first officer on the scene may not be the individual who completes the investigation. After the initial report is taken, a detective, or another officer with specialized skills, may be assigned to the case. Jurisdiction regarding law enforcement agencies’ responsibilities, as they relate to a particular crime, can vary.
Once the emergency needs of persons at the scene are met, officers then begin collecting evidence. From the beginning, it is critically important to preserve and safeguard evidence. Therefore, officers may be required to prohibit public access. Many times property must be removed from the crime scene and taken to the crime lab for processing. Families of crime victims will be kept away from the scene until evidence is secured. In order to collect and document evidence of the crime, officers may ask many questions of the victim, family members, neighbors, witnesses, and potential witnesses. These conversations are often audio taped or video taped. This seemingly intrusive technique can prevent unnecessary, repetitive interviews of the witnesses. Follow-up investigations can be conducted days, weeks, months, and even years after the initial investigation. Officers may need to revisit the crime scene and talk to victims and witnesses previously interviewed.
At the hearing, the defendant is asked whether he or she will enter a plea of guilty, not guilty, or nolo contendere (no contest). If the defendant pleads guilty or no contest, he or she will then be sentenced by the judge. A no contest plea has the same effect as a plea of guilty as far as the criminal sentence is concerned. If the defendant pleads not guilty, a trial date is set. The court also considers the amount of bail and other conditions of release, which permit the defendant to be out of jail until the trial. In Arkansas, every defendant is eligible for bail. Judges, however, are not required to set bail for defendants charged with capital murder where specific circumstances exist.
If a juvenile is an adjudicated delinquent, there are several disposition alternatives available to the judge. The judge may require the juvenile to undergo counseling, place the juvenile on probation, or require him or her to perform community service. Other available options are the C-Step Program, detention, and transfer into the custody of the Division of Youth Services. The judge will decide the appropriate alternative.

Training Requirements
Community-based correctional centers are currently located in Little Rock, Texarkana, Osceola, and Pine Bluff, and provide a balance between “punishment” and a program to help offenders become law-abiding members of society. These centers offer classes in substance abuse education, sobriety, relapse prevention, parenting, domestic violence, self-esteem, anger management, and a variety of employment skills.
Pre-sentence Report – A pre-sentence report is a detailed account of a convicted defendant’s educational, criminal, family, and social background conducted as an aid to the court in determining the sentence. The person preparing the pre-sentence report for the court shall make a reasonable effort to confer with the victim.

Law enforcement’s role does not end with the arrest of the alleged offender. Working closely with prosecuting attorneys, law enforcement officers frequently testify at trials. Officers testify on the contents of the police report, evidence collected at the scene, and how the evidence was preserved for presentation in court. Some law enforcement agencies in Arkansas also operate victim assistance programs within their departments. Specialized victim assistance coordinators provide a wide range of services to victims of crime. These services are discussed in the “Victim Services” section of this Guide.
If found “not competent,” the defendant will be ordered to the State Hospital for treatment where the goal is to restore the competency of the defendant. This treatment may last up to ten months. If found “not responsible”, the defendant is committed to the State Hospital for up to 30 days. This means that the defendant has been acquitted of the charges due to “mental disease or defect”. The person is committed to the State Hospital to determine if he or she presents a danger to himself or herself or the person or property of others.

Qualified Trainers
The Arkansas State CASA Association promotes and supports local programs providing qualified volunteer advocates to help abused and neglected children in juvenile dependency-neglect proceedings reach safe, permanent homes. CASA is a program where trained court appointed volunteers represent the best interest of an abused or neglected child for whom a placement is being determined by the juvenile court. A CASA volunteer acts as a fact finder of the child’s best interest, providing a judge with valuable information on the child to help the court make a sound decision about the child’s future.
**Expert Witness:** A witness qualified by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education to provide a scientific, technical, or other specialized opinion about the evidence or a fact issue.

Coverage Election
When a prosecutor believes a juvenile has committed a crime, he or she may choose to file a “delinquency petition”. The delinquency petition summons the juvenile to an “adjudication hearing”. If the allegations in a petition are found to be true, a juvenile is “adjudicated delinquent”. If he or she is to be incarcerated before or after the hearing, the child is placed in “juvenile detention” or “transferred into the Division of Youth Services’ custody”. These children who commit acts that would be criminal if committed by an adult are referred to as juvenile delinquents. Under Arkansas’ juvenile code, a delinquent juvenile is defined as a person age 10 through age 17.
Arkansas law requires that defendants have the opportunity to be represented by an attorney. If the defendant cannot afford to pay for an attorney, the court will appoint an attorney or public defender to represent the defendant. The defendant can, however, waive the right to an attorney and choose to represent himself or herself in the case. The defendant is not required to present any evidence at all, since he or she is innocent until proven guilty by the prosecution. The defense attorney may believe the prosecution has failed in proving its case and that it is not necessary to present his client’s defense.

Posting Requirements
When a law enforcement agency makes an arrest, the arrested person may or may not be immediately jailed. In less serious crimes, an offender may only be issued a citation ordering that they appear in court on a certain date. In cases involving more serious crimes, a court hearing is necessary to decide whether the offender should be released pending trial, resulting in a bond or bail being posted and a release from custody, perhaps hours after the arrest.
After the appeals process described is completed, defendants may seek what is called collateral or post-conviction relief in both state and federal court. Ordinarily, defendants begin seeking this type of relief in state court. In Arkansas, the relevant procedural law is contained in a court rule known as Rule 37. Rule 37 cases begin in the circuit courts where the criminal trial took place. Most often defendants challenge the effectiveness of their trial lawyers in these proceedings. A circuit court’s decision to grant or deny relief is appealable to the Arkansas Supreme Court and reviewable in the United States Supreme Court. If state post-conviction relief efforts fail, defendants can seek relief in federal district court by filing a petition for habeas corpus. The grant or denial of that relief is appealable to a federal intermediate appellate court and subject to being reviewed in the United States Supreme Court. State law also provides other potential avenues for relief by various petitions for extraordinary relief that may be filed in both the state trial courts and the Arkansas Supreme Court.
- Notice of sentence imposed or modifications to that sentence

In Arkansas, the prosecuting attorney is responsible for making the decision to charge a person with committing a crime based on the investigative information provided by law enforcement. Most crimes in Arkansas are defined by the Arkansas Criminal Code. It is vital to understand that criminal cases are brought by the State, not the victim of the crime. The prosecutor has the sole authority to bring charges and they can be brought contrary to the victim’s wishes. If the prosecutor decides to pursue the case, a document called an “information” is filed with the court. One of the first appearances by a defendant in court is often referred to as “plea and arraignment.”

Under Arkansas law, defendants are entitled to a jury trial for criminal cases. The defendant, however, can waive his or her right to a jury trial. When the defendant waives the right to a jury trial, the judge alone decides whether the defendant is guilty and determines the punishment. The trial court judge is an impartial official who along with the jury hears the case. Based on the law, the judge decides what evidence can be presented to the jury. The judge also instructs the jury at the end of the presentation of evidence on how the jury should apply the law to the facts.
Arkansas uses a “bifurcated” trial system. This means that the “guilt” phase is separate from the sentencing phase. After the “guilt phase” of the trial has ended, the jury will also decide the defendant’s punishment. Generally, the jury is allowed to return only one of two verdicts: guilty or not guilty. If the verdict is “not guilty,” the defendant is released. If the verdict is “guilty”, the court formally enters a judgment of conviction. Then, the sentencing phase of the trial begins. The sentencing phase is almost like another trial. Evidence of aggravating and mitigating circumstances that may not have been allowed during the guilt phase is now introduced.
