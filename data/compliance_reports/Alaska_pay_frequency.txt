What Should Employers Do?
Yes, but there are a few exceptions. If you work more than 8 hours in a single day and/or more than 40 hours in a single week, you must be paid time-and-one-half (1.5 times) your hourly or regular wage for those extra hours that you worked. Contact the Wage and Hour office ((907) 269-4900) if you have questions.
Yes, but any time you work over 8 hours in a single day and/or over 40 hours in a single week, your employer must pay you 1.5 times your hourly or regular wage for those extra hours over 8 and/or over 40 that you worked. If your employer is not paying you that overtime, then you can report wage theft to your local Wage and Hour office.
No. Giving you comp time instead of your overtime wages is not lawful in Alaska. You are entitled to overtime pay when you work overtime hours, and it must be paid on your paycheck and shown on your paystub.
Being paid a salary does not mean that you are not entitled to receive overtime. Some employees are exempt from overtime, such as executive, administrative, and professional employees, all of which require very specific criteria to be met. Your actual job duties, responsibilities and how you are paid usually determine your eligibility for overtime.

Training Requirements
Cash or cash register shortages, lost, missing, or stolen property can only be deducted if you have admitted willingly and in writing to having personally taken the specific amount of cash or property alleged to be lost, missing or stolen. If your employer has loaned you funds, they can deduct the amount from your earnings as long as you have given written authorization. It is not valid to sign a "blanket" authorization at the time of hire to cover future deductions. As a rule, deductions cannot reduce your gross pay below minimum wage or cut into your overtime. If you have borrowed money from a third party, you can give the employer written permission to deduct payments from your earnings. Of course, lawful deductions must be made, such as taxes and court-ordered deductions like child support or garnishments.

Training Deadlines
If you are terminated by your employer, your employer must pay you all monies owed within three working days after the day of termination (not counting weekends and holidays). If you quit, you must be paid by the next regular payday that is at least three working days after your last day worked.
**19) Why does my employer get 20 days to respond to the Department's letter concerning my wage claim, when they should pay me within 3 working days?** The Department has to ensure that your employer is given the opportunity to defend him/herself from your claim. This is called "due process." The Department uses the same time frame as the courts (20 days) as a fair amount of time for the employer to respond to your complaint.
Claims for unpaid overtime or minimum wage must be filed within two years from the date the work was actually performed. Claims for straight-time wages or other promised benefits should be filed within three years from the date the work was actually performed. You should file a claim as soon as you are aware that you may be owed additional wages.

Coverage Election
Yes. Starting July 1st, 2025, employers are required to provide their employees with sick leave under the provisions of Ballot Measure 1 that was passed in the 2024 General Election. You must earn at least 1 hour of sick leave for every 30 hours worked and may earn up to 56 hours of sick leave per year. Just as with the minimum wage, this is the minimum requirement and employers are free to offer a more generous sick leave/paid time off program.

Reciprocity/Extraterritorial Coverage
Your employer must give you a pay stub each pay period that explains how long you worked, how much money you earned and how much money you were paid. The stub must include the number of straight-time and overtime hours you actually worked; your rate of pay; your gross wages; your deductions for taxes; and other deductions you have authorized your employer to make. The pay stub also must state the beginning and ending dates of the pay period.

**7) How many employees must my employer have before he/she has to pay overtime?**

Employer Notification Requirements
Yes, as long as you are given written notice of the change the payday before it takes effect. For example, if your normal payday (the day you are paid your wages) is on the 20th of the month, your employer could give you written notice of a change in your rate of pay any day up to and including the 20th. All work done by you after the 20th would be at the new rate.
**16) What kind of information is my employer supposed to put on my pay stub?**
**17) I just gave my employer two weeks' notice and he/she fired me. What can I do?**

Posting Requirements

**17) I just gave my employer two weeks' notice and he/she fired me. What can I do?**

Recordkeeping Requirements
In Alaska, an employer does not need to give a reason to fire an employee. Therefore, he/she has not violated any wage and hour law. You may wish to check with an attorney to see whether you can file a civil lawsuit against your employer for wrongful discharge. If you believe you were discriminated against due to race, creed, color, age, religion, sex, or similar reasons, you may contact the Human Rights Commission at (907) 274-4692 or 1-800-478-4692.
**20) How much time do I have to file a claim after termination?**
Claims for unpaid overtime or minimum wage must be filed within two years from the date the work was actually performed. Claims for straight-time wages or other promised benefits should be filed within three years from the date the work was actually performed. You should file a claim as soon as you are aware that you may be owed additional wages.
