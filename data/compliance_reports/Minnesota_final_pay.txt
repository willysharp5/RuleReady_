Training Deadlines
Employees **who voluntarily leave employment (quit), are terminated, discharged or fired, but do not make a written demand,** are due all wages and commissions on the next regularly scheduled payday. If the payday is within five days of the last day of work, the employer may have up to 20 days to make final payment.
– By filing a claim in court, an employee may also recover one day of average wages for each day the employer is late in paying (up to 15 days).
