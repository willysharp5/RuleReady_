Maine Prevailing Wage Laws (public contracts)

Overview
This is the first year the Bureau has included the federal Davis-Bacon rates in its calculation of Maine’s prevailing wage and benefits rates. This is due to a statutory change enacted in the first session of the 131st Legislature (26 MRS § 1308(1)(C)). To do this, the Bureau first compiled 2,400 county-level prevailing wage rates through the regular process detailed in the [Rules Governing the Establishment and Use of Fair Minimum Wage Rates on State Construction Projects](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.maine.gov%2Fsos%2Fcec%2Frules%2F12%2F170%2F170c013.docx&data=05%7C02%7CKip.Mitchell%40maine.gov%7C88fea903ad59467238ac08dc12b22aff%7C413fa8ab207d4b629bcdea1a8f2f864e%7C0%7C0%7C638405804322575189%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=PACKHgzl5tgWbdxxSioNIQOtvH9HZ%2Bv79oiu6k5FMrw%3D&reserved=0). We then obtained the 773 county-level prevailing wage rates the Federal Department of Labor publishes for Maine under the Davis-Bacon Act for the three construction categories which we compile prevailing wages for (building, heavy, highway). After translating the federal trades to match our occupational classification system, we increased 133 State prevailing wage rates to match their corresponding federal Davis-Bacon prevailing wage rate _._
