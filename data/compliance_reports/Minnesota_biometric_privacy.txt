Minnesota Biometric Privacy / AI Use Laws (emerging)

Overview
The Minnesota Legislature passed the Consumer Data Privacy Act (“MCDPA”) to help safeguard consumers’ data and their right to privacy. The law provides Minnesota residents with the power to control how their data is used by companies and other parties.
The Attorney General’s Office enforces the MCDPA and ensures that businesses and covered entities follow the law. This website assists consumers in learning about and exercising their rights, as well as helps covered entities (called “controllers” and “processors”) understand their obligations.
