Mississippi Paid Sick Leave

Overview
Employees begin to earn and accumulate personal and major medical leave on the first working day of each month the employee works or receives paid leave. The personal leave is available for the employee’s use the first day of the month after the leave is earned. The appointing authority cannot increase the amount of personal leave to an employee's credit, and it is unlawful for an appointing authority to grant personal and major medical leave in an amount greater than was earned and accumulated by the employee.
Major medical leave may be used for the illness or injury of an employee or member of the employee's immediate family which is defined as spouse, parent, step-parent, sibling, child, step-child, grandchild, grandparent, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, mother in-law, father-in-law, brother-in-law or sister-in-law. The employee must remember that major medical leave can be used in this manner only after the employee has used one (1) day of accrued personal or compensatory leave. In the event that an employee has no accrued personal or compensatory leave, the first day of leave must be taken as leave without pay. This is a requirement for each absence due to illness.
