Oregon Final Pay / Vacation Payout

Overview
For purposes of [ORS 657.085 (Employment)](https://oregon.public.law/statutes/ors_657.085) and [657.087 (Employment)](https://oregon.public.law/statutes/ors_657.087), employment does not include service performed by certain individuals to the extent the compensation paid to such individuals consists of commissions, a share of the profit or overrides. The amount of a loan which legally and in fact obligates the borrower to repay the principal amount whether or not commission earnings, a share of the profit or overrides are applied to reduce the payable balance is not wages. However, service performed by an individual who receives a guaranteed payment (whether termed an advance, loan, income leveling, commission guarantee or other similar term) against future commissions, a share of the profit or overrides is employment and the amount of the guaranteed payment is wages.
