What Should Employers Do?
You are first eligible to receive payment of your Defined Contribution Retirement (DCR) Plan account when you have been terminated for at least 60 days, provided you are not rehired in a PERS or TRS position before 60 days have passed or are not active with the same employer in a different fund. Partial account payments are allowed, up to two per [calendar year](https://drb.alaska.gov/help/glossary.html#termC01), after the 60-day termination requirement has been met. Also, please keep in mind that if you rollover or refund DCR funds (even if it’s only a partial withdrawal), you may forfeit unvested employer matching contributions. If you return to DCR service in the future after taking a distribution from the DCR plan, you will start over on the vesting schedule for employer matching contributions.
After you have met the 60-day termination of employment requirement, you are eligible to apply your account balance to the payment option you choose. The actual dollar amount you will receive depends on such factors as the amount of your contributions, how your investments performed, the payment option you select, and your life expectancy. Payment options include:
and defer payment until you have obtained the age of Required Minimum Distribution
> You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The fund’s sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time.
