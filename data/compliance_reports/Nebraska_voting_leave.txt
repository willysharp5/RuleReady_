The ExpressVote prints out the paper ballot and does not record how a voter voted. The paper ballot can be reinserted into the ExpressVote where the voter's choices can be reviewed if desired. Reinserting the paper ballot does not allow the voter to change their choices. Once finished, the ballot is deposited in the ballot box with all other ballots to be counted.
