What Should Employers Do?
An ability to understand the English language is necessary in order to satisfy the statutory requirements of ss. 756.02 and 756.04. If a juror cannot meet the statutory requirements, then the entire trial process may be nothing more than an “exercise in futility." A defendant was prejudiced when a juror was allowed to serve who was not qualified under the statutes and did not have a sufficient understanding of English to meaningfully participate in the trial process. State v. Carlson, [2003 WI 40](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/document/courts/2003%20WI%2040), [261 Wis. 2d 97](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/document/courts/261%20Wis.%202d%2097), [661 N.W.2d 51](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/document/courts/661%20N.W.2d%2051), [01-1136](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/document/wisupremecourt/01-1136).
Wisconsin law does not permit a court to deliberately summon a greater number of potential jurors from some geographic areas than from others in an attempt to ensure that the racial and ethnic makeup of juries better reflects a representative cross-section of the community served by the court. Wisconsin law requires that all qualified persons have an equal opportunity to be randomly summoned for jury service. It does not permit a jury selection system that gives some persons greater, some lesser, opportunities to be summoned, depending on the area of the community where they live. [OAG 3-08](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/document/oag/oag3-08).
Jury summons, when and how issued.At least 12 days before the first day on which a jury is required to be present, to create the jury venire, the clerk of circuit court shall randomly select a sufficient number of prospective jurors from the jury array created under s. [756.04 (9)](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/document/statutes/756.04(9)) who shall be summoned to appear before the court at an appropriate time for jury service. The summons may be served by 1st class mail or another method.
[756.06(1)](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/document/statutes/756.06(1))(1)Whenever an issue is to be tried before a jury, the clerk of circuit court shall randomly select names from the jury venire until the desired number is obtained to create the jury panel. The random selection of names may include the provision that jurors reporting for service who have not been considered for assignment to a panel be considered before other jurors are considered for a second panel.
