| | **A.** | No, it is the employer's obligation to pay you on the established payday regardless of whether the timecard is submitted. There is no exception in the law that allows the employer to require you to wait until the next payday, or even until the timecard is turned in. Your employer can comply with the law, even without having your timecard, by paying all of the wages that it reasonably knows are due for your regularly scheduled work period. |

Coverage Election
| | **A.** | In the event the commissions have been "earned" on or before the date of your termination, the employer must complete the necessary calculations and pay the commissions on the date of the termination in the case of a discharge or a voluntary quit with more than 72 hours prior notice, or within 72 hours of the termination of the employment relationship in the case of a voluntary quit without such prior notice. It is not permissible for the employer to wait until the customary time for calculating the commissions of current employees, nor is it permissible to delay payment of such earned commissions until the next regularly scheduled payday. If the commission has not yet been earned at the time of termination and is awaiting the completion of some legal condition precedent, for example, receipt of the customer's payment, the commission must be paid to you immediately upon completion of the condition precedent. |

Reciprocity/Extraterritorial Coverage
Overtime wages must be paid no later than the payday for the next regular payroll period following the payroll period in which the overtime wages were earned. An employer shall be in compliance with Labor Code Section 226(a) relating to total hours worked by the employee if the overtime hours are recorded as a correction on the itemized statement for the next regular pay period and include the dates of the pay period for which the correction is being made. [Labor Code Section 204(b)(2)](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=LAB&sectionNum=204.)
Note to Employers:  If you have non-negotiated checks on your books which are made payable to employees whose employment has been terminated (i.e., because you are unable to locate the employee) and you have made all reasonable efforts to pay the wages, you may send the non-negotiated checks with an explanation of your efforts to contact the employee to the nearest office of the Labor Commissioner.  The Labor Commissioner will make further efforts to locate the employee to make payment of the wages and, if unsuccessful, the checks will be deposited into the State of California Unclaimed Wages Fund.  Click [here](https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/DistrictOffices.htm) to locate the nearest office of the Labor Commissioner.

| **6.** | **Q.** | **Is my employer required to keep payroll records?** |
| | **A.** | Yes. Every employer doing business in California must maintain comprehensive payroll records on each of its employees. |

Penalties for Non-Compliance
An employer who willfully fails to pay any wages due a terminated employee (discharge or quit) in the prescribed time frame may be assessed a waiting time penalty. The waiting time penalty is an amount equal to the employee's daily rate of pay for each day the wages remain unpaid, up to a maximum of thirty (30) calendar days. _Mamika v. Barca_ (1998) 68 Cal.App4th 487 An employee will not be awarded waiting time penalties if he or she avoids or refuses to receive payment of the wages due. If a [good faith dispute](https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/Glossary.asp?Button1=G#good%20faith%20dispute) exists concerning the amount of the wages due, no waiting time penalties would be imposed. A "good faith dispute" that any wages are due occurs when an employer presents a defense, based in law or fact which, if successful, would preclude any recovery on the part of the employee. The fact that a defense is ultimately unsuccessful will not preclude a finding that a good faith dispute did exist. However, a defense that is unsupported by any evidence, is unreasonable, or is presented in bad faith, will preclude a finding of a "good faith dispute". [Labor Code Section 203](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=LAB&sectionNum=203.) and [Title 8, California Code of Regulations, Section 13520](https://www.dir.ca.gov/t8/13520.html)
| | **A.** | Yes. Your payroll records must be made available to you upon reasonable request, which request must be complied with by your employer as soon as practicable, but no later than 21 calendar days from the date you make such request. Effective January 1, 2003, a failure by the employer to permit a current or former employee to inspect or copy his or her payroll records within the 21 day period entitles the current or former employee to recover a $750.00 penalty from the employer in a civil action brought before a court of competent jurisdiction. |
