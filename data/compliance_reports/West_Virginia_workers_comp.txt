Covered Employers
This guidance is intended for all insurance carriers, third-party claims administrators and self-insured employers. This guidance has been, at least in part, issued previously. However, this Insurance Bulletin is being issued with an effective date of **July 1, 2022_,_** due to the workers’ compensation litigation changes that are beginning to take effect, including the new duties and adjudicatory responsibilities of the Workers’ Compensation Board of Review and the subsequent termination of the Workers’ Compensation Office of Judges. As a result of these changes, it is critical that all stakeholders comply with this regulatory guidance.
Claimants who do not know the name or contact information for their employer’s workers’ compensation insurance carrier should be able to locate that information on the employer’s premises notice, as required by W.Va. Code §23-2C-15, or through the Coverage Verification System (CVS) at [www.wvinsurance.gov/Employer-Coverage](https://www.wvinsurance.gov/Employer-Coverage).
