Arkansas E-Verify / Employment Verification

Overview
You must follow-up on all case alerts and cases in the Status Change Report in E-Verify and reverify each current employee on Form I-9 whose EAD was revoked.

Covered Employers
E-Verify may have notified you via Case Alerts that one or more of your employees has an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) that has been revoked by DHS.  EADs that have been revoked will no longer appear in Case Alerts; instead, you should regularly generate the Status Change Report to identify E-Verify cases that may have been created with an EAD that is now revoked.  To access the report, log in to your E-Verify account and click on the “ **Reports**” tab at the top of the homepage to select the new Status Change Report.  E-Verify Employer Agents may create this report on behalf of their clients using the E-Verify browser. The chart below displays date ranges of EADs that were revoked by DHS with the corresponding date that the data in the Status Change Report was updated.
If you have a current employee who appears on the Status Change Report, you should compare your employee’s EAD card number presented for Form I-9 which was used to create the E-Verify case to the revoked document number in the report to determine if you must reverify your employee’s employment authorization. If the numbers match, reverification is required. E-Verify employers must use [Form I-9, Supplement B](https://www.uscis.gov/i-9-central/form-i-9-resources/handbook-for-employers-m-274/60-completing-supplement-b-reverification-and-rehire-of-form-i-9), to immediately begin reverifying each current employee whose EAD the Status Change Report indicated was revoked, or if your employee voluntarily discloses to you that their EAD has been revoked, and complete all reverifications within a reasonable amount of time.
The Status Change Report is intended to help employers determine if the EAD they used to create any E-Verify cases has been revoked. Employers who find that any of those EADs were revoked must reverify their employees whose revoked EAD was used to create their E-Verify case. The report does not replace an employer’s legal requirement to verify employment eligibility for their employees in accordance with the Form I-9 process.
