Covered Employers
The Maine State Plan covers all state and local government workers in the state. It does not cover federal government workers. Federal government workers, including those employed by the United States Postal Service and civilian workers on military bases, are covered by OSHA. OSHA also exercises authority over private sector employers in the state and federal OSHA standards apply to these workers. A brief summary of the Maine State Plan is included in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) at [29 CFR 1952.28](https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1952/1952.28). OSHA retains the authority to monitor the State Plan under Section 18(f) of the OSH Act.
The Maine Department of Labor conducts workplace inspections. If violations are identified, citations and proposed assessments of penalties are issued. State and local government employers may contest citations and proposed penalties before the Board of Occupational Safety and Health. The Maine Department of Labor enforces a provision prohibiting retaliation for occupational safety or health activity. More information on enforcement can be found on the Maine State Plan website.
