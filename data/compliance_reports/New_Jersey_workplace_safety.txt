A brief summary of the New Jersey State Plan is included in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) at [29 CFR 1952.25](https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1952/1952.25). OSHA retains the authority to monitor the State Plan under Section 18(f) of the OSH Act.
New Jersey PEOSH offers voluntary and cooperative programs that focus on reducing injuries, illnesses, and fatalities. New Jersey's PEOSH also offers on-site consultation services which help employers comply with PEOSH's standards and identify and correct potential safety and health hazards. New Jersey also has an agreement with OSHA, under Section 21(d) of the OSH Act, to provide free on-site consultation services to the private sector. For more information on these programs, please visit the New Jersey State Plan website.
Under the PEOSH Act, employers, workers, and/or other affected parties may seek informal review with NJDLWD and contest orders before the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission.
