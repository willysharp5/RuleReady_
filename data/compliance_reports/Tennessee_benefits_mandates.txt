The amount, if any, provided by the state for employer matching contributions shall be specifically prescribed in the general appropriations act each such year. (3) Notwithstanding subdivision (a)(1) or another law to the contrary, for the fiscal year beginning on July 1, 2022, the state employer match equals two hundred percent (200%) of the amount contributed by each state employee to the plan per month, up to a maximum of one hundred dollars ($100) per month. In subsequent fiscal years, the employer match reverts to the calculation described in subdivision (a)(1). (4) Notwithstanding subdivision (a)(1) or another law to the contrary, for the fiscal year beginning on July 1, 2023, the state employer match equals one hundred percent (100%) of the amount contributed by each state employee to the plan per month, up to a maximum of one hundred dollars ($100) per month.

(b) Notwithstanding this or any other provision to the contrary, the amount of the employer matching shall not exceed the maximum allowed under the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C.) and shall conform to all applicable laws, rules and regulations of the internal revenue service governing profit sharing and/or salary reduction plans for state employees. (c) It is the legislative intent that the employer match pursuant to this section shall be provided each fiscal year as the general appropriations act sets forth the dollar amount to be matched and contains an appropriation to provide for such matching amount. Further, it is the legislative intent that the amount, terms and conditions of any employer matching of contributions pursuant to subsection (a) for employees of institutions of higher education shall be governed in accordance with the same provisions affecting state employees who are paid on the centralized state payroll system.
