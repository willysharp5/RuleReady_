New Hampshire Paid Sick Leave

Overview
| Overview | Employees with catastrophic illnesses may face overwhelming financial obstacles if they exhaust all paid time off during a disability leave, and the stress of worrying about paying the rent or putting food on the table detracts from focusing on wellness. The State of New Hampshire Supplemental Sick Leave Plan gives eligible employees an opportunity to donate accrued sick leave hours from their unused balance to a fellow employee. Participation in this program is strictly voluntary for both donors and requestors. Supplemental sick leave will only be granted for emergent serious or life-threatening illnesses, injuries, impairments, or mental or physical conditions that have caused, or are likely to cause, the employee to take leave without pay provided appropriate medical information is provided. Supplemental sick leave will not be granted for common, minor or chronic illnesses, injuries, impairments or physical or mental conditions. |
