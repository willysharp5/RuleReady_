Covered Employees
A wage determination issued for a project specifies the wage and fringe benefit rates for each classification of worker, determined to be prevailing in that locality for that type of construction or other work covered under the statute. Wage Determinations are based on the applicable prevailing wage rate determinations made by the U.S. Secretary of Labor under the provisions of the Davis-Bacon Act, 40 U.S.C. § 276 et seq. as amended.

What Should Employers Do?
No, helper is not included in a General Wage Determination. If you think your project needs a “helper” wage determination you must prove the following conditions:
If you believe that you need additional wage determinations for one or more labor classifications, please submit the “Request for Additional Wage Classification” form, listed in the Forms and Related Information section above. In this form you will be able to list any additional classifications needed, the job descriptions, and a suggested wage rate, if you have one available. Include any relevant documents with your form and DOLI will respond to your request informing you of our decision along with an updated Wage Determination sheet for the area in question. Please note that this form must be sent to DOLI from the contracting agency, but the form should contain the contractor’s suggested wage rate.
Using the guidance of [AAM 130 and 131](https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/WHD/legacy/files/memo-131.pdf), Virginia follows the United States Department of Labor’s process for multiple wage determinations. First, at least one of two conditions must apply:
The wage determination that is given during the bid solicitation and related contract award establishes the rate that must be paid for the entire term of the contract. The contracting agency in charge of the project will have an accurate, up-to-date copy of the correct wage determination to share with potential contractors.

Training Requirements
If the apprentice or trainee is registered in a bona fide apprenticeship program that is registered with the United States Department of Labor, Commonwealth of Virginia, or out-of-state agency, then the wages paid to such an individual will be specified by the apprenticeship or training agreement and is not subject to prevailing wage rates.
##### What if a wage rate changes during the course of a public works project?

Training Deadlines
DOLI relies primarily on the DBA General Wage Determinations for each area within Virginia. In the event of a missing classification, all relevant information is used to find a wage rate that bears a reasonable relationship to the other wage rates contained in the general wage determination.

Qualified Trainers
Anyone paying less than the prevailing wage rate is liable to the individual for all wages and benefits plus interest at an annual rate of 8%. The contractor or subcontractor will also be disqualified from bidding on public works projects until full restitution has been made to the individual.

Special Requirements
##### Does the Virginia Department of Labor and Industry do specific project wage determinations?
There are no specific project determinations made. All projects subject to Virginia’s Prevailing Wage Act come from the general wage determination. DOLI will add specific classifications to the general wage determination as needed.
##### What if I need an additional classification in order to support my bid?
