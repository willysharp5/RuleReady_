Covered Employees
The State of Colorado currently offers employees a comprehensive leave program that includes, but is not limited to annual, sick, holiday, family medical, short-term disability and military leave. Employees earn annual and sick leave at varying accrual rates, based on years of service. Full-time employees begin earning annual leave at an accrual rate of 8 hours per month and sick leave at 6.66 hours per month. Leave for a part-time employee is earned on a pro-rated basis.
These frequently asked questions have been developed to support State employees in understanding the administrative leave day granted by the Governor, known as a Governor’s Holiday.
**A:** It is administrative leave the Governor grants to State employees during the holidays. The intent is to reward all permanent, full-time and part-time State employees with time off in the spirit of a holiday(s) and to show appreciation for State service.
