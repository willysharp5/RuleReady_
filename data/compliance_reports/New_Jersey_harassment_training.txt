Employees are entitled to work in an environment that is free from harassment and discrimination. As a supervisor, understanding the laws and your role in promoting a workplace that embraces diversity and respect is paramount. This one-day course will equip participants with the knowledge to protect themselves and others from harassment and discrimination. It will also emphasize how supervisors can foster awareness and inclusion as a method to help prevent prohibited behaviors. Key federal and State of New Jersey laws, including the NJ Law Against Discrimination (NJ LAD), and policies will be reviewed as participants explore the implications and proper reporting procedures of workplace harassment and discrimination pursuant to the NJ State Policy Prohibiting Discrimination in the Workplace.
