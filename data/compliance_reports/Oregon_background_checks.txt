Training Requirements
Private employers (including recruiting agents) are prohibited from printing an ad for employment that requires applicants to be currently employed. Employers may continue to include job qualifications including education, certification and experience. Employers may also continue to limit a vacancy to those currently employed
No. Most employers may not legally obtain or use an applicant’s or employee’s credit history information. Of course, there are some exceptions; these include:
Unless another law provides a specific exemption, employers (including recruiting agents) are prohibited from printing an ad for employment that requires applicants to be currently employed. Employers may continue to include job qualifications including education, certification and experience. Employers may also continue to limit a vacancy to those currently employed with that employer (internal only recruitments).

Training Deadlines
_What is your religious affiliation? Are you able to work Saturdays and Sundays?_
It is unlawful to discriminate against an applicant due to their religion, or lack thereof. Employers are also required to reasonably accommodate an applicant’s sincerely held religious beliefs, which may include not working on certain days of the week. If working a particular schedule is an essential function of the job, simply state that fact and ask whether the applicant is able to work the schedule.
The Portland ordinance covers any employer with six or more employees when they employ someone for a position being performed a majority of the time within Portland. (The Portland ordinance does not include the United States Government; the State of Oregon and any office, department, agency, authority, institution, association, society or other body of the state, including the legislature and the judiciary; any political subdivision of the state of Oregon or any county, city, district, authority, public corporation or public entity other than the City of Portland, or employers with fewer than six employees.)

Qualified Trainers
Applying these exceptions can be complicated; you may wish to contact a qualified employment law attorney for advice on a particular situation.

Under the more stringent Portland “ban the box” ordinance, an employer may consider your criminal history in the hiring process only after making a conditional offer of employment. This means that an employer violates the ordinance if it accesses an applicant’s criminal history prior to making the conditional job offer. If a criminal history is used to make the employment decision, an employer must make a good faith determination that a specific offense or conduct is job-related and consistent with business necessity.

Employer Responsibilities & Deadlines
Oregon’s “ban the box” law makes it unlawful for an employer to ask about your criminal history before the interview stage of hiring. In Portland, employers must wait until a conditional job offer has been made before inquiring about criminal histories.
- Employers who are required by law to use credit history for employment purposes;
1. An essential function of the job requires access to financial information beyond that typically required in a retail transaction (meaning in general the employee would have access to information beyond credit card numbers, checking accounts or debit card numbers); or
2. The employer is required to obtain credit history information as a condition of bonding or insuring the employee.

Employer Notification Requirements
There are restrictions on the kind of questions employers can ask or information they can require you to give. These restrictions apply to an applicant’s salary history, credit history, employment status and (through “ban the box” laws) criminal history.

Posting Requirements
While employers have the right to enforce fragrance-free workplace policies and Oregon’s Indoor Clean Air Act requires almost all employers to maintain smoke-free workplaces and display “no smoking” signs, Oregon law prohibits discrimination based on lawful off-duty tobacco use.

No, neither the state law or the Portland ordinance prevent employers from considering an applicant’s history of criminal convictions in making the final hiring decision. The “ban the box” requirements also do not prohibit employers from letting applicants know during recruitment that criminal background will be considered. Employers are still able to make a job offer contingent upon consideration of an applicant’s criminal record.
It is better to state that if hired, a new employee must present documentation sufficient to establish work authorization in the United States.
