North Carolina Crime Victim / Domestic Violence Leave

Overview
A Domestic Violence Protective Order, often called a “DVPO” or a “50B order,” is a court order that requires a perpetrator of domestic violence to stay away from the victim. Law enforcement can arrest the perpetrator on the spot for violating the order. In North Carolina, a “permanent” DVPO can last for up to one year, but can be renewed for up to two years at a time.
If you are a victim of sexual assault or stalking and do not have a relationship qualifying for a DVPO, you can file for a no-contact order, often called a “50C order,” against the perpetrator. The process for getting a 50C order is similar to the process for getting a DVPO. The main difference between the two orders is that the police will not arrest a defendant for violating a 50C order. Instead, 50C orders can be enforced by the judge holding the defendant in contempt of court. You can get the form needed to file for a 50C order from the clerk of court in your county or [online here](https://www.nccourts.gov/documents/forms/complaint-for-no-contact-order-for-stalking-or-nonconsensual-sexual-conduct).

Covered Employers
Some counties allow magistrates to grant emergency DVPOs outside of business hours, but others only grant DVPOs on business days when the courthouse is open. Your local domestic violence agency can give you more information about your county’s process.
Legal Aid of North Carolina is a statewide nonprofit organization that represents some victims in DVPO cases. You can apply for Legal Aid representation either through your local domestic violence agency, by calling 1-866-219-5262, or by [applying online](https://legalaidnc.org/apply/).

What Should Employers Do?
A Domestic Violence Protective Order, often called a “DVPO” or a “50B order,” is a court order that requires a perpetrator of domestic violence to stay away from the victim.

Next, the sheriff must “serve” the defendant, by personally delivering a copy of all court paperwork, including the complaint filled out by the plaintiff and the ex parte order. The case can move forward only after the defendant has been served.
DVPOs typically require that the defendant have no contact with the plaintiff and stay away from places such as the plaintiff’s home, school and workplace. DVPOs can also include specific requirements depending on the circumstances of the case. In some circumstances, judges may decide additional issues, such as who can stay in the home or use a shared car while the DVPO is in effect.
The process of filing for a DVPO is designed to be accessible to people representing themselves. However, court officials, such as judges and clerks of court, cannot provide you with legal advice about your rights and obligations or the likely outcome of your case based on your situation. If you represent yourself in court, you will be held to the same rules of procedure and evidence as a licensed attorney.

Domestic violence is a pattern of abusive behavior within an intimate relationship intended to gain power and control over the victim. This can include physical violence, sexual abuse, threats, humiliation, constant criticism or name-calling, isolating the victim from others, or limiting the victim’s access to money, transportation, or employment. Both men and women can be perpetrators and victims of domestic violence.

A plaintiff is a person who files a case in civil court, including a protective order. A defendant is a person a court case is filed against.

Penalties for Non-Compliance
In order to get a DVPO, the plaintiff needs to show that the defendant committed an act of domestic violence as defined by North Carolina law. The law provides for a judge to give a DVPO if the defendant intentionally committed one of the following acts against the plaintiff or a child in the plaintiff’s custody:
If you are in immediate danger, you should call 911. Violation of a DVPO is a crime, and you can take out charges either by calling the police or by visiting the magistrate. If there are no criminal charges for the violation, a judge can hold the defendant in contempt of court for violating a court order. To begin this process, you can file a “ [Motion for Order to Show Cause](https://www.nccourts.gov/documents/forms/motion-for-order-to-show-cause-domestic-violence-protective-order).” The clerk of court can provide a copy of the form, which can also be [found here](https://www.nccourts.gov/documents/forms/motion-for-order-to-show-cause-domestic-violence-protective-order).
