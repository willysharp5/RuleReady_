What Should Employers Do?
If you receive a subpoena, or other order of the Court, that requires you to appear during working hours, you will receive time off with pay and without loss of earned leave time unless you are a plaintiff or defendant in the court action. If you are required to appear in court as part of your work assignment or your official function, the time spent is considered time worked.
Managers receive time off to serve during any period of jury duty. Regular salary is continued during jury service. Payment for jury service received from the court system, except for travel allowances, must be returned to the state. Contact your HR Department if you are summoned for jury duty.
Leaves of absence without pay may be granted to allow time off for good reason. If you find it necessary to request a leave of absence without pay, submit a request to your supervisor with as much advance notice as possible. State the reason the leave is necessary and the expected date of the leave. Generally, the state continues the health insurance payment for permanent employees when the approved leave of absence is due to illness or pregnancy. Otherwise, speak to your payroll office regarding how insurance coverage can be continued, how premium payments are made, who is covered, the duration of the coverage, and the amount of the premiums that must be paid. Leaves of absence are subject to post audit by DAS.
Medical certificates, such as the [P-33A](https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/DAS/Statewide-HR/A---Z-Listing-Task-PDFs/FMLA-Employee-Medical-Certificate.pdf), signed by a licensed physician or other practitioner whose healing method is recognized by the state, are required:

Each of these types of leave is recorded using a specific code but the time is charged against sick leave balances, provided that the leave is approved and the employee has sufficient accruals. If an employee is approved to take time for these purposes but does not have enough sick leave accruals to cover the absences, then the employee’s absence must be recorded using other accrued leave or leave without pay attendance codes. See “Sick Leave, Exhaustion of.”

Coverage Election
Regulation 5-240-5a (f) allows for an employee to be put on leave of absence with pay for up to 15 days to permit the investigation of alleged serious misconduct. Regulation 5-240-5a (g) allows for an employee to be put on leave of absence with pay for 30 days (plus extensions under certain circumstances) pending disposition of criminal charges. Please note these are the general rules; some contracts address this subject specifically and may contain information in addition to the regulations. In all cases of administrative leave, the agency must notify the employee in writing of the reason for the leave, the effective date of the leave, and the leave du-ration. The employee should also be advised s/he must be available to report to work immediately, if appropriate, depending on circumstances following the investigation. In cases involving pending criminal charges which could lead to dismissal upon conviction, the employee may request a voluntary leave of absence without pay. Approval of such leave is within the discretion of the agency. For more information on administrative leaves and leaves of absence without pay pending criminal charges, please contact your agency Human Resources Department.
