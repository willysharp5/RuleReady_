Employer Notification Requirements
AKOSH is responsible for the enforcement of Alaska OSHA safety and health standards, regulations, and other provisions, including a prohibition against retaliation for occupational safety or health activity. AKOSH utilizes the AKOSH Field Operations Manual to provide guidance for the enforcement program. Compliance officers inspect workplaces for hazardous conditions and issue citations where violations of AKOSH standards, regulations, and other provisions of the state occupational safety and health statute are found. Inspections may be the result of regular scheduling, imminent danger reports, fatalities, worker complaints or referrals. More information on enforcement in Alaska can be found on the Alaska State Plan website.
AKOSH offers voluntary and cooperative programs focused on reducing injuries, illnesses, and fatalities. AKOSH also offers on-site consultation services which help employers comply with AKOSH standards, regulations, and other provisions of the state occupational safety and health statute and identify and correct potential safety and health hazards. For more information on these programs, please visit the Alaska State Plan website.
