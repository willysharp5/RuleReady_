Overview
This page provides guidance about methods and approaches to achieve de-identification in accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Privacy Rule. The guidance explains and answers questions regarding the two methods that can be used to satisfy the Privacy Rule’s de-identification standard: Expert Determination and Safe Harbor [1](http://www.hhs.gov/www.hhs.gov#_edn1).  This guidance is intended to assist covered entities to understand what is de-identification, the general process by which de-identified information is created, and the options available for performing de-identification.
In developing this guidance, the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) solicited input from stakeholders with practical, technical and policy experience in de-identification.  OCR convened stakeholders at a workshop consisting of multiple panel sessions held March 8-9, 2010, in Washington, DC. Each panel addressed a specific topic related to the Privacy Rule’s de-identification methodologies and policies. The workshop was open to the public and each panel was followed by a question and answer period.  Read more on the [Workshop](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/special-topics/de-identification/2010-de-identification-workshop/index.html) on the HIPAA Privacy Rule's De-Identification Standard.

Covered Employers
1.2 [Covered Entities, Business Associates, and PHI](http://www.hhs.gov/www.hhs.gov#coveredentities)
The HIPAA Privacy Rule protects most “individually identifiable health information” held or transmitted by a covered entity or its business associate, in any form or medium, whether electronic, on paper, or oral. The Privacy Rule calls this information _protected health information_ (PHI) [2](http://www.hhs.gov/www.hhs.gov#_edn2). Protected health information is information, including demographic information, which relates to:
## Covered Entities, Business Associates, and PHI

Covered Employees
The importance of documentation for which values in health data correspond to PHI, as well as the systems that manage PHI, for the de-identification process cannot be overstated.  Esoteric notation, such as acronyms whose meaning are known to only a select few employees of a covered entity, and incomplete description may lead those overseeing a de-identification procedure to unnecessarily redact information or to fail to redact when necessary.  When sufficient documentation is provided, it is straightforward to redact the appropriate fields.  See section 3.10 for a more complete discussion.
Imagine a covered entity was aware that the anticipated recipient, a researcher who is an employee of the covered entity, had a family member in the data (e.g., spouse, parent, child, or sibling). In addition, the covered entity was aware that the data would provide sufficient context for the employee to recognize the relative.  For instance, the details of a complicated series of procedures, such as a primary surgery followed by a set of follow-up surgeries and examinations, for a person of a certain age and sex, might permit the recipient to comprehend that the data pertains to his or her relative’s case.  In this situation, the risk of identification is of a nature and degree that the covered entity must have concluded that the recipient could clearly and directly identify the individual in the data.  Therefore, the data would not have satisfied the de-identification standard’s Safe Harbor method.

What Should Employers Do?

3.8 [Must a covered entity suppress all personal names, such as physician names, from health information for it to be designated as de-identified?](http://www.hhs.gov/www.hhs.gov#supress)
3.9 [Must a covered entity use a data use agreement when sharing de-identified data to satisfy the Safe Harbor Method?](http://www.hhs.gov/www.hhs.gov#safeharbordatause)
3.10 [Must a covered entity remove protected health information from free text fields to satisfy the Safe Harbor Method?](http://www.hhs.gov/www.hhs.gov#protected)

Training Requirements
Satisfying either method would demonstrate that a covered entity has met the standard in §164.514(a) above.  De-identified health information created following these methods is no longer protected by the Privacy Rule because it does not fall within the definition of PHI.  Of course, de-identification leads to information loss which may limit the usefulness of the resulting health information in certain circumstances. As described in the forthcoming sections, covered entities may wish to select de-identification strategies that minimize such loss.
There is no specific professional degree or certification program for designating who is an expert at rendering health information de-identified.  Relevant expertise may be gained through various routes of education and experience. Experts may be found in the statistical, mathematical, or other scientific domains.  From an enforcement perspective, OCR would review the relevant professional experience and academic or other training of the expert used by the covered entity, as well as actual experience of the expert using health information de-identification methodologies.
Yes.  Experts may design multiple solutions, each of which is tailored to the covered entity’s expectations regarding information reasonably available to the anticipated recipient of the data set.  In such cases, the expert must take care to ensure that the data sets cannot be combined to compromise the protections set in place through the mitigation strategy. (Of course, the expert must also reduce the risk that the data sets could be combined with prior versions of the de-identified dataset or with other publically available datasets to identify an individual.) For instance, an expert may derive one data set that contains detailed geocodes and generalized aged values (e.g., 5-year age ranges) and another data set that contains generalized geocodes (e.g., only the first two digits) and fine-grained age (e.g., days from birth).  The expert may certify a covered entity to share both data sets after determining that the two data sets could not be merged to individually identify a patient.  This certification may be based on a technical proof regarding the inability to merge such data sets.  Alternatively, the expert also could require additional safeguards through a data use agreement.

Training Deadlines
Satisfying either method would demonstrate that a covered entity has met the standard in §164.514(a) above.  De-identified health information created following these methods is no longer protected by the Privacy Rule because it does not fall within the definition of PHI.  Of course, de-identification leads to information loss which may limit the usefulness of the resulting health information in certain circumstances. As described in the forthcoming sections, covered entities may wish to select de-identification strategies that minimize such loss.
Yes. The notion of expert certification is not unique to the health care field.  Professional scientists and statisticians in various fields routinely determine and accordingly mitigate risk prior to sharing data. The field of statistical disclosure limitation, for instance, has been developed within government statistical agencies, such as the Bureau of the Census, and applied to protect numerous types of data. [5](http://www.hhs.gov/www.hhs.gov#_edn5)
The Privacy Rule does not explicitly require that an expiration date be attached to the determination that a data set, or the method that generated such a data set, is de-identified information.  However, experts have recognized that technology, social conditions, and the availability of information changes over time.  Consequently, certain de-identification practitioners use the approach of time-limited certifications.  In this sense, the expert will assess the expected change of computational capability, as well as access to various data sources, and then determine an appropriate timeframe within which the health information will be considered reasonably protected from identification of an individual.

Qualified Trainers
The Privacy Rule was designed to protect individually identifiable health information through permitting only certain uses and disclosures of PHI provided by the Rule, or as authorized by the individual subject of the information.  However, in recognition of the potential utility of health information even when it is not individually identifiable, §164.502(d) of the Privacy Rule permits a covered entity or its business associate to create information that is not individually identifiable by following the de-identification standard and implementation specifications in §164.514(a)-(b).  These provisions allow the entity to use and disclose information that neither identifies nor provides a reasonable basis to identify an individual. [4](http://www.hhs.gov/www.hhs.gov#_edn4) As discussed below, the Privacy Rule provides two de-identification methods: 1) a formal determination by a qualified expert; or 2) the removal of specified individual identifiers as well as absence of actual knowledge by the covered entity that the remaining information could be used alone or in combination with other information to identify the individual.
A qualified expert may apply generally accepted statistical or scientific principles to compute the likelihood that a record in a data set is expected to be _unique, or linkable to only one person,_ within the population to which it is being compared. Figure 4 provides a visualization of this concept. [13](http://www.hhs.gov/www.hhs.gov#_edn13) This figure illustrates a situation in which the records in a data set are not a proper subset of the population for whom identified information is known.  This could occur, for instance, if the data set includes patients over one year-old but the population to which it is compared includes data on people over 18 years old (e.g., registered voters).

3.7 [If a covered entity knows of specific studies about methods to re-identify health information or use de-identified health information alone or in combination with other information to identify an individual, does this necessarily mean a covered entity has actual knowledge under the Safe Harbor method?](http://www.hhs.gov/www.hhs.gov#specificstudies)

Coverage Election
The HIPAA Privacy Rule protects most “individually identifiable health information” held or transmitted by a covered entity or its business associate, in any form or medium, whether electronic, on paper, or oral. The Privacy Rule calls this information _protected health information_ (PHI) [2](http://www.hhs.gov/www.hhs.gov#_edn2). Protected health information is information, including demographic information, which relates to:
In general, the protections of the Privacy Rule apply to information held by covered entities and their business associates.  HIPAA defines a covered entity as 1) a health care provider that conducts certain standard administrative and financial transactions in electronic form; 2) a health care clearinghouse; or 3) a health plan. [3](http://www.hhs.gov/www.hhs.gov#_edn3)  A business associate is a person or entity (other than a member of the covered entity’s workforce) that performs certain functions or activities on behalf of, or provides certain services to, a covered entity that involve the use or disclosure of protected health information. A covered entity may use a business associate to de-identify PHI on its behalf only to the extent such activity is authorized by their business associate agreement.

Reciprocity/Extraterritorial Coverage
The increasing adoption of health information technologies in the United States accelerates their potential to facilitate beneficial studies that combine large, complex data sets from multiple sources.  The process of de-identification, by which identifiers are removed from the health information, mitigates privacy risks to individuals and thereby supports the secondary use of data for comparative effectiveness studies, policy assessment, life sciences research, and other endeavors.
(B) All geographic subdivisions smaller than a state, including street address, city, county, precinct, ZIP code, and their equivalent geocodes, except for the initial three digits of the ZIP code if, according to the current publicly available data from the Bureau of the Census:

This page provides guidance about methods and approaches to achieve de-identification in accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Privacy Rule. The guidance explains and answers questions regarding the two methods that can be used to satisfy the Privacy Rule’s de-identification standard: Expert Determination and Safe Harbor [1](http://www.hhs.gov/www.hhs.gov#_edn1).  This guidance is intended to assist covered entities to understand what is de-identification, the general process by which de-identified information is created, and the options available for performing de-identification.
1.1 [Protected Health Information](http://www.hhs.gov/www.hhs.gov#protected)
2.6 [How do experts assess the risk of identification of information?](http://www.hhs.gov/www.hhs.gov#assess)

Posting Requirements
Imagine that a covered entity is considering sharing the information in the table to the left in Figure 3. This table is devoid of explicit identifiers, such as personal names and Social Security Numbers.  The information in this table is distinguishing, such that each row is unique on the combination of demographics (i.e., _Age_, _ZIP Code_, and _Sex_).  Beyond this data, there exists a voter registration data source, which contains personal names, as well as demographics (i.e., _Birthdate_, _ZIP Code_, and _Sex_), which are also distinguishing.  Linkage between the records in the tables is possible through the demographics.  Notice, however, that the first record in the covered entity’s table is not linked because the patient is not yet old enough to vote.
A third class of methods that can be applied for risk mitigation corresponds to _perturbation_.  In this case, specific values are replaced with equally specific, but different, values.  For instance, a patient’s age may be reported as a random value within a 5-year window of the actual age.  Table 5 illustrates how perturbation (i.e., gray shaded cells) might be applied to Table 2.  Notice that every age is within +/- 2 years of the original age.  Similarly, the final digit in each ZIP Code is within +/- 3 of the original ZIP Code.
Using such methods, the expert will prove that the likelihood an undesirable event (e.g., future identification of an individual) will occur is very small.  For instance, one example of a data protection model that has been applied to health information is the _k_-anonymity principle. [18](http://www.hhs.gov/www.hhs.gov#_edn18), [19](http://www.hhs.gov/www.hhs.gov#_edn19)  In this model, “ _k_” refers to the number of people to which each disclosed record must correspond.  In practice, this correspondence is assessed using the features that could be reasonably applied by a recipient to identify a patient.  Table 6 illustrates an application of generalization and suppression methods to achieve 2-anonymity with respect to the Age, Sex, and ZIP Code columns in Table 2.  The first two rows (i.e., shaded light gray) and last two rows (i.e., shaded dark gray) correspond to patient records with the same combination of generalized and suppressed values for Age, Sex, and ZIP Code.  Notice that Sex has been suppressed completely (i.e., black shaded cell).

Recordkeeping Requirements
In developing this guidance, the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) solicited input from stakeholders with practical, technical and policy experience in de-identification.  OCR convened stakeholders at a workshop consisting of multiple panel sessions held March 8-9, 2010, in Washington, DC. Each panel addressed a specific topic related to the Privacy Rule’s de-identification methodologies and policies. The workshop was open to the public and each panel was followed by a question and answer period.  Read more on the [Workshop](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/special-topics/de-identification/2010-de-identification-workshop/index.html) on the HIPAA Privacy Rule's De-Identification Standard. [Read the Full Guidance](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/ocr/privacy/hipaa/understanding/coveredentities/De-identification/hhs_deid_guidance.pdf).
For example, a medical record, laboratory report, or hospital bill would be PHI because each document would contain a patient’s name and/or other identifying information associated with the health data content.
By contrast, a health plan report that only noted the average age of health plan members was 45 years would not be PHI because that information, although developed by aggregating information from individual plan member records, does not identify any individual plan members and there is no reasonable basis to believe that it could be used to identify an individual.

Penalties for Non-Compliance
In general, the protections of the Privacy Rule apply to information held by covered entities and their business associates.  HIPAA defines a covered entity as 1) a health care provider that conducts certain standard administrative and financial transactions in electronic form; 2) a health care clearinghouse; or 3) a health plan. [3](http://www.hhs.gov/www.hhs.gov#_edn3)  A business associate is a person or entity (other than a member of the covered entity’s workforce) that performs certain functions or activities on behalf of, or provides certain services to, a covered entity that involve the use or disclosure of protected health information. A covered entity may use a business associate to de-identify PHI on its behalf only to the extent such activity is authorized by their business associate agreement.
In §164.514(b), the Expert Determination method for de-identification is defined as follows:
There is no explicit numerical level of identification risk that is deemed to universally meet the “very small” level indicated by the method.  The ability of a recipient of information to identify an individual (i.e., subject of the information) is dependent on many factors, which an expert will need to take into account while assessing the risk from a data set.  This is because the risk of identification that has been determined for one particular data set in the context of a specific environment may not be appropriate for the same data set in a different environment or a different data set in the same environment.  As a result, an expert will define an acceptable “very small” risk based on the ability of an anticipated recipient to identify an individual.  This issue is addressed in further depth in Section 2.6.
Yes.  Experts may design multiple solutions, each of which is tailored to the covered entity’s expectations regarding information reasonably available to the anticipated recipient of the data set.  In such cases, the expert must take care to ensure that the data sets cannot be combined to compromise the protections set in place through the mitigation strategy. (Of course, the expert must also reduce the risk that the data sets could be combined with prior versions of the de-identified dataset or with other publically available datasets to identify an individual.) For instance, an expert may derive one data set that contains detailed geocodes and generalized aged values (e.g., 5-year age ranges) and another data set that contains generalized geocodes (e.g., only the first two digits) and fine-grained age (e.g., days from birth).  The expert may certify a covered entity to share both data sets after determining that the two data sets could not be merged to individually identify a patient.  This certification may be based on a technical proof regarding the inability to merge such data sets.  Alternatively, the expert also could require additional safeguards through a data use agreement.
