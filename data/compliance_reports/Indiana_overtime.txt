Overview
**This information is for employees of Indiana State Government only. Persons not employed by Indiana state government should contact their employer’s Human Resources Office or the nearest U.S. Department of Labor Office.**
All employees in state civil service are divided into two categories for purposes of determining whether or not they are entitled to additional compensation for additional hours worked:

Covered Employers
**This information is for employees of Indiana State Government only. Persons not employed by Indiana state government should contact their employer’s Human Resources Office or the nearest U.S. Department of Labor Office.**
Overtime work must generally be approved in advance, although public safety and emergencies may require retroactive approval consistent with agency policy. Each agency must submit a plan to State Budget Agency outlining anticipated overtime needs for the fiscal year. Overtime work not anticipated in those plans must be reported within one business day.
Overtime-eligible employees must report all time worked (rounded to the nearest quarter-hour) in the time-reporting system used by the employing agency. The instructions below specifically apply to the PeopleSoft® / Time and Labor reporting system, although the concepts requiring regular reporting and monitoring of all hours worked and agreement between employee and employer for compensatory time off apply to all overtime-eligible employees in state government.

Covered Employees
**This information is for employees of Indiana State Government only. Persons not employed by Indiana state government should contact their employer’s Human Resources Office or the nearest U.S. Department of Labor Office.**
All employees in state civil service are divided into two categories for purposes of determining whether or not they are entitled to additional compensation for additional hours worked:
- Exempt: Those employees who are employed in an executive, administrative or professional capacity as defined by 29 CFR Part 541, and who are not covered by the federal minimum wage and overtime compensation laws; or

What Should Employers Do?
These categories have meaning based on the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) which defines compensable hours of work and minimum wage requirements. Other relevant laws, rules, and policies applicable to employees of Indiana state government are referenced below.
Employees who are required to work on days designated as state holidays may choose to receive compensatory time off to take on another day. That comp time is Holiday Comp Time which is always paid at the straight rate. Holiday pay/comp time is not counted as hours worked in the calculation toward determining whether or not a premium pay rate applies in a particular calendar week work period; however, hours spent on holidays actually performing work are counted for overtime-eligible employees in determining the appropriate pay rate for overtime hours worked in that calendar week.
Overtime work must generally be approved in advance, although public safety and emergencies may require retroactive approval consistent with agency policy. Each agency must submit a plan to State Budget Agency outlining anticipated overtime needs for the fiscal year. Overtime work not anticipated in those plans must be reported within one business day.
Supervisors should set priorities and ensure that employees are managing their time with good planning and effective work habits; however, when overtime work is necessary, supervisors must follow agency procedures to request and secure authorization for such additional work.
