The Compliance Unit monitors and assists employers to ensure that employers fulfill two requirements under the Workers Compensation Act: the requirement to secure workers compensation benefits for employees, and the requirement to file reports of alleged work accidents. Failure to secure workers compensation benefits, and failure to report accidents, can result in monetary penalties against the employer or its coverage provider. Failure to secure workers compensation benefits can also result in closure of the business.
Generally, an employer in a non-agricultural business, with more than $20,000 , must secure workers compensation benefits for its employees. An employer can secure workers compensation benefits in one of three ways:

Special Requirements
**The Workers Compensation Exception:** The HIPAA regulations specifically allow covered entities to disclose health information as authorized by, and to the extent necessary to comply with, workers compensation laws (45 CFR § 164.512). Kansas workers compensation law and regulations require health care providers to provide health information to employers, insurance carriers and the Director of Workers Compensation without the injured worker's authorization (K.S.A. 44-515; 44-557a, K.A.R. 51-9-10; 51-9-16). Therefore, a health care provider may disclose health information related to a workers compensation claim to the parties involved in the claim, or to the Division of Workers Compensation without the patient's authorization and such disclosure will not violate the HIPAA regulations.
