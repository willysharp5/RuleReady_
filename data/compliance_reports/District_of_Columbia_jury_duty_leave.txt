Covered Employees
The District government is committed to providing support to employees in fulfilling their civic duties. This issuance provides additional information about the various leave entitlements available to employees who are summoned to witness or jury service.
When a court or administrative tribunal summons a District government employee to appear and provide testimony or to produce evidence in any judicial or administrative proceeding, the leave options available to the employee depend on the nature of the proceeding and the capacity in which the employee is appearing.
An employee may be eligible to receive either their regular pay or court leave in these types of proceedings.

What Should Employers Do?
- If it is unclear whether the employee will be providing testimony or producing evidence in their official capacity or personal capacity, the agency head shall contact the judicial or administrative body issuing the summons for clarification.
- If the employee is to appear in their personal capacity, they shall receive paid court leave for time they spend providing testimony or producing evidence when a court or administrative tribunal summons them to appear and provide testimony or to produce evidence in any proceeding where the District of Columbia, the United States, or another state or local government is a party.
Employees must use their own **annual leave** or **compensatory time** or be placed in a leave without pay status as appropriate in these types of proceedings. Employees are not eligible to receive paid court leave for providing testimony or producing evidence in such proceedings.
Court leave is an authorized absence from work without loss of or reduction in pay, loss of leave, or loss of credit for time or service. Court leave shall be granted whenever an eligible employee is summoned to perform jury service or witness service. Court leave is granted only for the period actually spent in jury or witness service, plus reasonable travel time. If an employee on court leave is excused from jury or witness service for half or more of a workday, agency heads, at their discretion, may require the employee to return to duty or use their own annual leave or compensatory time, or have the employee placed in a leave without pay status for the remainder of the day.

Special Requirements
The District government is committed to providing support to employees in fulfilling their civic duties. This issuance provides additional information about the various leave entitlements available to employees who are summoned to witness or jury service.
Under District regulations, court leave may be used on a substituted basis under certain circumstances. This includes employees who are on annual leave generally or on annual leave under an advance notice of separation due to a reduction in force when they are summoned to perform jury or witness service. Additionally, an employee who is a **successful plaintiff** in an action against the District government brought under the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and who used annual leave, compensatory time, or leave without pay shall be made whole by substituting court leave for any leave or compensatory time used or forfeited.
As court leave compensates employees who, if not serving as a juror or witness, would have been on duty or in a paid leave status at the time of their service, such employees on approved court leave are generally not entitled to retain jury or witness fees and must turn over any such fees received to their agencies. Exceptions include:

Coverage Election
Employees are entitled to receive **court leave** for the duration of any service as a grand juror or petit juror in any jurisdiction, including time spent pursuant to a summons to appear for such service. This entitlement applies whether the employee is actually selected to serve on such jury or juries.
**EXAMPLE:** A District employee receives a summons to report for jury service. She reports to the courthouse as directed but is ultimately not selected to serve as a juror. The employee is still entitled to receive court leave for the time spent appearing pursuant to her jury service summons.

Reciprocity/Extraterritorial Coverage
## Judicial or administrative proceeding in which the District of Columbia, the United States, or another state or local government is a party.
- If the employee is to appear in their personal capacity, they shall receive paid court leave for time they spend providing testimony or producing evidence when a court or administrative tribunal summons them to appear and provide testimony or to produce evidence in any proceeding where the District of Columbia, the United States, or another state or local government is a party.

Employer Responsibilities & Deadlines
Employees must use their own **annual leave** or **compensatory time** or be placed in a leave without pay status as appropriate in these types of proceedings. Employees are not eligible to receive paid court leave for providing testimony or producing evidence in such proceedings.
Employees are only required to turn over witness or jury fees received if they have been approved for court leave. Employees who used their own annual leave or compensatory time or have been placed in a leave without pay status while on witness or jury service may retain all witness or jury fees received.
As court leave compensates employees who, if not serving as a juror or witness, would have been on duty or in a paid leave status at the time of their service, such employees on approved court leave are generally not entitled to retain jury or witness fees and must turn over any such fees received to their agencies. Exceptions include:
**EXAMPLE:** A District employee typically earns $22 per hour. They are summoned to serve as a juror and are approved to use court leave for the 5 hours they spend at the courthouse during jury selection. At the end of jury selection, the employee receives $150 as a jury fee. As the employee received $110 in compensation from their agency for court leave (5 hours x $22), they are permitted to retain $40 from the fee. The remaining $110 must be turned over to their agency.
