An employer must pay the agreed wage until such time that a new rate is agreed upon. Once you and the employer have specifically discussed and agreed upon a new rate, it is considered the “agreed wage.” Wage and Hour does not have jurisdiction over promised raises. A raise is at the discretion of the employer.
Most employees are entitled to be paid time and one-half their regular rate of pay for any time worked over 40 hours in the employer’s seven-day workweek. Even though the total hours (work hours plus holiday, vacation, or sick) for the week might exceed 40, overtime pay is not required unless an employee actually worked more than 40 hours. However, there are certain exceptions. Agricultural workers are generally exempt from overtime. Executives, administrative, and professionals who are paid on a salary basis are exempt from overtime as are outside sales persons. (Salaried workers who do not meet the definition of executive, administrative, or professional must be paid overtime in addition to their salary.) The definitions of these can be located here at this [website](https://erd.dli.mt.gov/labor-standards/wage-and-hour-payment-act/index).

Coverage Election
The first thing to do is ask the employer why you haven’t received your final check. If the employer refuses to give you your final check, you may choose one of the three options to obtain your wages:
Private sector employers are not required to pay out severance pay, sick leave, or paid time off (PTO). These are considered benefits and may be paid based on the employer’s policies. There is no requirement in state law to provide these benefits. In the case of a PTO benefit, payout of this benefit is dependent on the employer’s policy as stated in the [Montana Supreme Court's ruling in McConkey v Flathead Electric Cooperative.](https://erd.dli.mt.gov/_docs/labor-standards/McConkey-v-Flathead-Electric-Cooperative.pdf)

Reciprocity/Extraterritorial Coverage
