Covered Employees
To provide efficient dispute resolution for injured workers and employers by administering both formal adjudication and informal dispute resolution services; to serve the public by answering inquiries regarding the Indiana Worker's Compensation system; and to collect statistical information regarding workplace injuries in Indiana.
Compensation paid to workers injured after July 1, 2023 will be at a higher rate, per PL160. You can find the rates [here](https://www.in.gov/wcb/insurance-carriers/resources).
Procedural Guidance on Hospital and Facility Reimbursement, and Guidelines for Determining the Pecuniary Liability of an Employer to a Medical Service Facility may be found [here](https://www.in.gov/wcb/providers/). The new provisions in these documents will go into effect on January 1, 2023 for dates of service beginning in January. The changes are necessitated by amendments to the Worker’s Compensation Act made by Public Law 160. While these documents provide assistance, they are neither laws nor regulations.

What Should Employers Do?
It also establishes clean claim payment requirements related to workers’ compensation claims and removes outdated language and makes conforming amendments.
Once inside the Appearance module, you will have the option to search for a case. A combination of two out of three options is required to find a specific case: Dispute Number, Date of Injury, or Last Name.  After searching, select the party you wish to represent. Once submitted, an email will be sent to all attorneys already on the case. Additionally, in the case of a pro se plaintiff, the notice will be sent to the case coordinator and the pro se if we have an email for them.
- **Notice 4/2/20** The agency has received numerous questions regarding worker’s compensation coverage for employees who contract Covid-19, particularly those on the front lines.  In Indiana, workers’ compensation benefits are paid by employers, not the State.  Under our laws, the State cannot tell employers they must automatically cover employees who contract Covid-19.  Whether an individual contracts the virus in the course and scope of their employment is a determination that must initially be made by the employer. This decision is routinely made at the time the employee notifies the employer of the injury, or in this case, contraction of the virus.It is well accepted that first responders, as defined in P.L.113-2020, and health care providers, as defined at IC 16-18-2-163, as well as others directly involved in the provision of services to those exhibiting symptoms of Covid-19 are more susceptible to contraction of the disease as a direct result of their work duties.   Others whose jobs necessarily entail close interaction with many people in a public setting are also more vulnerable to exposure and possible infection than those working remotely or in a limited office setting.Employers are urged to consider making a prospective decision as to whether any vulnerable segment of their workforce will be presumptively covered under the provisions of the Indiana Worker’s Compensation Act should they:  a.) Be quarantined at the direction of the employer due to a confirmed or suspected Covid-19 exposure, b.) Receive a Covid-19 diagnosis from a physician without a test, c.) Receive a presumptive positive Covid-19 test, or d)  Receive a laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 diagnosis. Employers are encouraged to relay such decisions to their workforce and workers’ compensation insurance carrier/third party administrator as soon as possible in order to allay fears and expedite the claims process.  Plans of action upon any occurrence listed above should also be communicated.
- **Notice 3/13/20** ELECTRONIC FILINGS-On April 1st, 2020, the Board will begin accepting Third Party Settlements and Partial Settlement Agreements electronically through the district emails currently used for full and final settlements.  While Third Party Settlements do not require approval from the Board, many do submit them and we will continue to accept them.  This limited set of filings will be processed similarly to full and final settlements.Later this year, the Board will switch to an upload system, at which time other agreed submissions, oaths, appearances and change of venue requests will be accepted digitally
