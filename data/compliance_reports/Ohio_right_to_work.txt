Ohio Right-to-Work Laws (where applicable)

Overview
Several state employees represented by National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation attorneys filed a lawsuit challenging the State of Ohio’s and OCSEA’s “maintenance of membership” requirement. In a settlement agreement resolving the lawsuit, the State of Ohio and OCSEA agreed to rescind that requirement and to permit employees who had signed the union membership card at issue in the lawsuit to at any time resign their union membership and stop the deduction of union dues from their wages.
If you signed a new membership and dues deduction card that purports to restrict when you can stop the deduction of union dues from their wages, you can contact the Foundation for free legal assistance at \[ [https://www.nrtw.org/free-legal-aid/](https://www.nrtw.org/free-legal-aid/)\].

# SPECIAL LEGAL NOTICE TO STATE OF OHIO EMPLOYEES
This is a special legal notice for individuals employed by the State of Ohio who are represented by the Ohio Civil Service Employees Association, AFSCME Local 11 (“OCSEA”). As a result of a recent settlement agreement, State employees can resign their membership in OCSEA and stop the deduction of union dues from their wages at any time by sending a resignation letter to OCSEA unless they sign a new union membership and dues deduction card.
In June 2018, the United States Supreme Court in _Janus v. AFSCME_, Council 31 held it violates the First Amendment for a state to require that its employees pay dues or fees to a union. Unfortunately, the State of Ohio and OCSEA prohibited State employees from exercising their First Amendment rights under Janus by requiring that employees who were union members in May 2018 must remain dues-paying union members until February 2021.
