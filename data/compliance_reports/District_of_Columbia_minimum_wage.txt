District of Columbia Minimum Wage

Overview
Employers are generally subject to both state child labor laws and the federal child labor provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), 29 U.S.C. 212(c), and the FLSA regulations at 29 CFR Part 570. Certain provisions of District of Columbia law may be less restrictive than federal law, and employers covered by the FLSA that only follow a less restrictive provision of District of Columbia law will be in violation of federal law. See 29 U.S.C. 218(a). For more information on federal child labor law, please visit the U.S. Department of Labor’s Wage and Hour Division Website at [www.dol.gov/whd](http://www.dol.gov/whd).
The Office of Wage-Hour conducts compliance audits and works to recover unpaid wages for employees who have not been paid pursuant to DC wage laws, either administratively or through court action. Wage-Hour compliance involves ensuring adherence to the wage laws of the District of Columbia by holding employers accountable to the laws.
