- Louisiana emphasizes accurate payment of wages to all employees. As per the [Louisiana Wage Payment Act](https://www.legis.la.gov/legis/Law.aspx?d=83945), employers must pay employees their wages due to an employee on time. Especially when an employee leaves the company or is terminated, the final payout must include the regular earnings and any accrued benefits that the employee is entitled to, such as accrued vacation pay.

This pay regulation applies across various sectors. Any unnecessary delay in receiving earned wages can prompt legal actions from employees.
- Furthermore, there are industry-specific rules in Louisiana regarding wage payments. For instance, employers in the oil and gas industry must pay their employees at least twice per month on regularly scheduled paydays. If there are no designated paydays, the wages must be paid on the 1st and 16th of each month. The same norms apply to employers of mining, manufacturing, and public service corporations. Other private employers don’t have such regulations, and establishing their pay periods and paydays is at their discretion.
- Louisiana has no mandatory vacation time laws, so PTO depends on internal policies and contractual agreements. If any oral or written commitment regarding PTO exists between employer and employee, it must be followed.

Louisiana is one of the few states that allow “use it or lose it” vacation policies. Under these policies, employers can ask employees to utilize their accrued vacation time within a specific period, typically within the year it is accrued. Louisiana PTO laws make it legal for employers to restrict employees from carrying over unused vacation days to the subsequent year.

As of 2024, no Louisiana PTO laws on vacation time accrual exist. In Louisiana, most employees are provided paid time off and have the freedom to create an accrual system that fits their business model and requirements. The states treat earned vacation time as wages. Hence, employers are legally obligated to pay such compensation under certain conditions. This status of accrued vacation pay as a wage is pivotal because it ensures that employees are compensated for their earned but unused vacation time.

Recordkeeping Requirements
However, when implementing “use it or lose it” policies, employers must ensure that these policies are carefully crafted, clearly communicated, and applied consistently. The details should be documented in the employee handbook or the employment contract and accessible to all employees for review.
If an employee files a well-founded lawsuit for unpaid vacation pay, the employer may also be liable for the employee’s reasonable attorney fees if proven guilty. Employees can file a lawsuit three days after making the first demand for unpaid wages after resignation or termination.

Penalties for Non-Compliance
Failure to pay employees accrued or earned vacation time can have significant legal consequences. Under the Louisiana Wage Payment Act, employees are entitled to their accrued vacation pay upon termination of employment. If an employer violates the act, they could owe either 90 days of wages at the employee’s daily rate of pay or the full wages from when the employee’s demand for payment is made until the employer pays or tenders the amount due, whichever is less. This penalty is in addition to the unpaid wages owed to the employee.
