Chapter 151B prohibits workplace harassment on the basis of actual or perceived membership in a protected class, or the association with others who are members of a protected class. There are two main categories of harassment based on protected class: "quid pro quo" harassment and "hostile work environment" harassment. An employee may suffer one or both types of harassment simultaneously, depending on the circumstances.
Quid Pro Quo harassment can occur when an employer conditions an employee’s continued employment or receipt of workplace benefits, promotions, assignments, or opportunities on their willingness to mute or change behaviors or characteristics tied to the employee’s actual or perceived, membership of a protected class.

What Should Employers Do?
Massachusetts law requires employers with six or more employees to adopt a written policy against sexual harassment. The employer's policy must include notice to employees that sexual harassment in the workplace is unlawful and that it is unlawful to retaliate against an employee for filing a complaint of sexual harassment. The policy should also assert the employer's commitment to investigate any complaint of sexual harassment. The Commission has prepared a [Model Sexual Harassment Policy](https://www.mass.gov/doc/model-sexual-harassment-policy/download) and a [Sexual Harassment Poster](https://www.mass.gov/doc/mcad-sexual-harassment-poster/download).
