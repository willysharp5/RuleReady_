Pennsylvania Harassment Training

Overview
## The Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission (PHRC) issued proposed guidance on “Harassment in Educational Settings” on August 8, 2024. The PHRC now seeks additional feedback from the public specific to the impact of it utilizing a negligence standard in lieu of the deliberate indifference standard originally proposed in its guidance.
Discrimination exists in all Pennsylvania communities and therefore the PA Human Relations Commission recognizes that this guidance has widespread impact. We strive to solicit feedback from educators and parents from all corners of the Commonwealth.
