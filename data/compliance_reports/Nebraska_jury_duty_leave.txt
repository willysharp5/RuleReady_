Nebraska Jury Duty Leave

Overview
1. **Trial Jury**, sometimes known as a petit jury. The trial jury decides both criminal and civil cases and may consist of 6 or 12 members. These jury trials take place in the courtroom, in the presence of the judge, the jury, the attorneys and the public.  In a criminal case, a person accused of a crime may confront witnesses and may be convicted only when each juror is convinced of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. In a civil case, a trial jury decides whether the plaintiff has provided enough evidence that it is more likely than not (preponderance of the evidence) that the defendant injured the plaintiff in some way that requires compensation. The information below describes the process of a trial jury.
This site provides general statewide information. To get answers to specific questions about jury service in your county, please contact your local jury commissioner. In most cases, the Clerk of the District Court serves as the jury commissioner. If the Clerk doesn’t serve as commissioner, he or she will know who does.

Covered Employers
- [Employer of Juror Brochure](https://supremecourt.nebraska.gov/sites/default/files/Administration/employer-brochure.pdf)
**Will my employer allow me to take time off for jury service?**
State law prohibits your employer from penalizing you. You cannot be fired, lose pay (except that your employer may reduce your pay by the $35 per day you receive for jury duty), lose sick leave, or lose vacation time.

Covered Employees
Nebraska jurors are permitted, but not required, to take notes during trials. Notes may be used during jury deliberations, but are confidential between the juror taking the notes and the other jurors. Court staff will destroy all notes immediately after the verdict is announced.

2. [**Grand Jury**](https://supremecourt.nebraska.gov/sites/default/files/Administration/grand-jury.pdf).  The function of a grand jury is entirely different than the trial jury.  It consists of 16 members and 3 alternates whose functions are conducted in secrecy.  The grand jury has the responsibility to investigate charges of crimes and, if the investigation warrants, to make an accusation against an individual by returning an indictment against the person.  The decision to indict is normally made solely on the basis of the state’s evidence without the accused person having the opportunity to present his or her side of the case.
You were selected to serve on a jury from a county voter registration, state I. D., or driver’s license list.  An impartial, random method of selection from these lists is required by law.

Penalties for Non-Compliance
The State is represented by the prosecuting attorney. The person charged is called the defendant. Criminal cases are punishable by probation, fine, imprisonment, or death. The jury does not sentence the defendant. Sentences are imposed by the judge.
The clerk of the court is responsible for court records, summonses, subpoenas, collection of fines, and other court business. The court reporter transcribes a word-for-word record of all court testimony and proceedings.
