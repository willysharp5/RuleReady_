In worker’s rights cases, such as wage and hour or workplace safety complaints, the jurisdiction almost always falls to the authority that offers the most protection for the worker; **in the case of wages, it falls to the jurisdiction with the highest minimum wage that can be enforced.** The State enforces the minimum wage in State statute. If a municipality were to increase their minimum wage, cases that fall within a municipality’s jurisdiction fall to that public entity to enforce. The regulations that provide the greatest protections prevail in an enforcement action.

What Should Employers Do?
Employers are still liable for all recordkeeping and poster requirements under federal, state, and municipal regulations. Typically, three sets of minimum wage posters will need to be posted and updated accordingly. In addition, employers must ensure that their record keeping meets the highest standards among the three enforcement entities.
Under most municipal ordinances, employers have the responsibility to ensure that the highest wage is paid based on the location of where the work was performed. For example, in the case where an employee who works within a city for one day but outside the city on other days, an employer may be required to break down the rates of pay per jurisdictional requirements.
