Montana Overtime & Hours

Overview
- The regular rate of an employee paid on a commission, piece rate, or flat book rate basis is arrived at by dividing the total weekly earnings by the total number of hours actually worked in the week. The employee is entitled to payment of one-half this regular rate for each hour worked over 40 - in addition to the full commission or piecework earnings.
