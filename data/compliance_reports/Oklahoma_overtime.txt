Oklahoma Overtime & Hours

Overview
(A) Compensatory time at the rate of time and one-half is granted to non-exempt employees for all time actually worked in excess of the regular 40 hour week.
(B) Hours in any type of leave status, with the exception of jury duty per Merit Rule [OAC 530:10-15-46](http://okrules.elaws.us/oac/530:10-15-46) and [OKDHS:2-1-50](https://oklahoma.gov/okdhs/library/policy/current/okdhs/chapter-2/subchapter-1/parts-1/court-or-jury-leave.html), are not included in the computation of hours worked for purposes of determining hours to be compensated at the premium rate of time and one-half.

Covered Employers
(4) The Executive Branch of the State of Oklahoma is one employer for FLSA purposes; therefore, concurrent employment in more than one agency is considered joint employment.  Employees working in one or more nonexempt positions in Executive Branch agencies, and who work more than 40 total hours per week, are eligible for overtime.  An OKDHS employee may not be employed by another state agency without the prior written approval of the employee's division director.  It is the responsibility of all agencies involved to ensure that all FLSA requirements associated with multiple agency appointments are met.

Covered Employees
(a) **Compensatory time.**  It is the policy of the Oklahoma Department of Human Services (OKDHS) to use compensatory time in lieu of overtime payment for non-exempt employees except in resource centers and other residential care facilities.  Local administrators establish and implement guidelines for how non-exempt employees utilize compensatory time.
(2) **Requirements.**  Compensatory time is requested and approved in the same manner as annual leave.  Supervisors approve employee requests to use compensatory time unless the requests disrupt OKDHS operations or endanger public health, safety, or property.
(A) Employees are responsible for making requests for use of compensatory time within a reasonable time period of the date it was earned.

What Should Employers Do?
(2) **Requirements.**  Compensatory time is requested and approved in the same manner as annual leave.  Supervisors approve employee requests to use compensatory time unless the requests disrupt OKDHS operations or endanger public health, safety, or property.
(B) Accrued compensatory time must be used prior to any approval for annual leave unless such use would result in the forfeiture of annual leave due to accrual limitations as provided in Merit Rules.
(C) Except for employees in group home, residential facility, or resource center settings where 24-hour care, monitoring, or supervision is required for clients or residents, supervisors may require non-exempt employees to use accrued compensatory time when determined by the supervisor to be warranted or appropriate.
(c) **Overtime pay.**  Overtime pay in lieu of compensatory hours for non-exempt employees requires the approval of the Director and is granted only in exceptional circumstances.  Managers and supervisors request and receive approval from the Director prior to authorizing non-exempt employees to work the overtime for payment.  Managers and supervisors are responsible for ensuring that overtime payments are minimized.  Overtime payment is made by entering the overtime hours into the timekeeping system, except situations requiring submission of Form 10PL003E, Overtime Wage Exemption Claim, to the Finance Division Payroll Unit.

Training Requirements
(5) Compensatory time is entered on the OKDHS time/leave system as it is accrued and taken, in accordance with instructions issued by the Finance Division Payroll Unit.

Training Deadlines

(A) compensatory time not used within 180 days of the pay period it accrued is paid at the appropriate overtime rate; and
(A) Employees are responsible for making requests for use of compensatory time within a reasonable time period of the date it was earned.
