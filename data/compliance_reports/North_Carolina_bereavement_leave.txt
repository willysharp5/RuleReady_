North Carolina Bereavement Leave

Overview
Bereavement Leave is available to employees of a participating agency that experience the loss of an immediate family member or a colleague with whom they worked in their current agency, so long as the colleague worked for that agency within the last year. Eligible employees are those who are permanent, probationary, or time-limited, and either full-time or part-time with a schedule that is at least half-time. Temporary employees, interns and contractors are not eligible for Bereavement Leave. Part-time employees are not eligible for Bereavement Leave if they work less than half-time.
For the purposes of Bereavement Leave, immediate family member has the same meaning as defined in the Sick Leave policy. It is someone having a relationship with the employee included in the chart below:

Covered Employers
All Cabinet agencies are participating, as are any state agencies, commissions, boards, or offices that choose to adopt the policy related to Bereavement Leave. Employees of a Non-Cabinet Agency should watch for communications from their employer related to this policy.
Supervisors shall approve the use of Bereavement Leave following the loss of an immediate family member for the date requested if it involves attendance at a funeral, visitation or other memorial event. Otherwise, the supervisor shall approve the use of Bereavement Leave for the date(s) requested by the employee to the greatest extent possible, while maintaining business operations. For instances other than attendance at a funeral, visitation or other memorial event for an immediate family member, the supervisor or other manager may require that the Bereavement Leave be taken at a time other than the one requested, based on the needs of the agency.
Supervisors shall approve the use of Bereavement Leave following the loss of a colleague for the date requested to the greatest extent possible, while maintaining business operations. It is possible that not everyone who requests time off to attend a funeral or other memorial event for a colleague will be able to attend, if it hinders business operations or the safety of the workplace.

Bereavement Leave will provide 40 hours of paid leave for eligible employees following the loss of an immediate family member. It also provides paid leave to attend the funeral or other memorial event of a colleague. This is another way for the State of North Carolina to show we value our most important asset, our employees, by ensuring they can care for themselves and their loved ones after experiencing a loss.
