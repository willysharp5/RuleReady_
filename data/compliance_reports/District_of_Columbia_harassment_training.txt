District of Columbia Harassment Training

Overview
On October 31, 2023, Mayor Muriel Bowser issued a Mayor’s Order updating DC Government’s sexual harassment policy. The Mayor’s Order, which clarifies and strengthens many provisions from the 2017 order, reaffirms that DC Government does not tolerate any form of inappropriate workplace conduct including sexual harassment, nor does it tolerate sexual harassment in non-employment interactions between DC Government employees and the public.
Complainants of sexual assault or other possible crimes should contact the DC Victim Hotline. The Hotline, 1-844-443-5732, is available 24/7 by telephone, text or online chat to seamlessly connect victims of crime to free resources to help them navigate the physical, financial, legal, and emotional repercussions of crime. In particular, through the Hotline, victims may be matched with an advocate who can help them decide whether to pursue a matter through the criminal justice process.
