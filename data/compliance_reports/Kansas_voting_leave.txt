Covered Employers
If your interest in serving your community lies outside the proverbial courthouse steps, there are several organizations that specialize in cultivating a spirit of volunteerism within Kansans and matching them with the right opportunities:
The [Kansas Association of Volunteer Engagers](https://kanserve.org/Volunteer/Kansas-Association-of-Volunteer-Engagers) (KAVE) is a statewide association with a mission to inspire, support, and encourage Kansas who recruit and utilize volunteers. This organization was created to build a network of volunteer management professionals in Kansas with the desire to share best practices and develop new skills.
[Volunteer Kansas](https://www.volunteerkansas.org) works with organizations in many areas including: education, children and families, animal welfare, violence and bullying, poverty, environment, health and fitness, disaster relief, human rights and more. Helping these organizations find volunteers makes Kansas a better place to live.

What Should Employers Do?
Civic engagement is the cornerstone of our government. Participation in free and fair elections by eligible voters is critical to ensure that future generations continue to enjoy the freedoms that we have worked hard to establish. However, civic engagement goes beyond exercising your rights to vote. It also includes the obligations that we owe to our communities and fellow Kansans.
The responsibility for voting and elections in Kansas lie primarily with:
The Kansas Secretary of State oversees the integrity of elections, while the Kansas Legislature creates the laws and requirements related to voting and elections.
In order to exercise your right to vote in Kansas, you must meet the criteria that are listed above.

Training Deadlines
**Registering to vote** is a prerequisite to casting your ballot. Registration can be done [online](https://www.kdor.ks.gov/apps/voterreg/) or via [paper forms](https://www.sos.ks.gov/forms/elections/voterregistration.pdf). You must be registered to vote at least 21 days prior to Election Day. Same-day voter registration is not allowed in Kansas, although you may be provided a provisional ballot if your registration is in question. Keep in mind that if you change your name, move, or switch party affiliation you will need to [re-register](https://www.kdor.ks.gov/apps/voterreg/). Likewise, if you have been [disqualified from voting because of a current felony sentence](http://www.kslegislature.org/li/b2021_22/statute/021_000_0000_chapter/021_066_0000_article/021_066_0013_section/021_066_0013_k/), you will need to [re-register](https://www.kdor.ks.gov/apps/voterreg/) once your sentence is complete.
When it is time to cast your vote, **Kansas offers two voting options**: both traditional “day-of” voting and [advance voting](https://sos.ks.gov/elections/elections-faq.html#Advance-Voting). Advance voting may be conducted up to 20 days before and no later than one week before Election Day. Your advance vote may be cast in advance at your [county election office](https://www.sos.ks.gov/elections/county_election_officers.aspx) or via mail-in ballot.
Federal law establishes that federal elections will be conducted on the [Tuesday following the first Monday in November](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title2-section7&num=0&edition=prelim). Many states, including Kansas, have adopted this as the date on which they conduct state and municipal elections. However, you should keep in mind that there are many other important dates and deadlines related to elections. These dates are established far in advance and are made public in the interest of transparency and accessibility.

Special Requirements
If you have registered to vote and you have opted to cast your ballot in person on Election Day, you will need to visit your assigned polling place. In general, **polling places are required to be open from 7:00am to 7:00pm on Election Day**. If your local polling place has adopted different hours, they must announce those hours publicly through their [county election office](https://www.sos.ks.gov/elections/county_election_officers.aspx). Remember that while your polling place has specific hours, as long as you are in line while the polls are open, you still have the right to vote!
