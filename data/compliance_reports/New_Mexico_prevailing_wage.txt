Covered Employers
A. Every contract or project in excess of sixty thousand dollars ($60,000) that the state or any political subdivision thereof is a party to for construction, alteration, demolition or repair or any combination of these, including painting and decorating, of public buildings, public works or public roads of the state and that requires or involves the employment of mechanics, laborers or both shall contain a provision stating the minimum wages and fringe benefits to be paid to various classifications of laborers and mechanics, which shall be based upon the wages and benefits that will be determined by the director to be prevailing for the corresponding classifications of laborers and mechanics employed on contract work of a similar nature in the state or locality, and every contract or project shall contain a stipulation that the contractor, subcontractor, employer or a person acting as a contractor shall pay all mechanics and laborers employed on the site of the project, unconditionally and not less often than once a week and without subsequent unlawful deduction or rebate on any account, the full amounts accrued at time of payment computed at wage rates and fringe benefit rates not less than those determined pursuant to Subsection B of this section to be the prevailing wage rates and prevailing fringe benefit rates issued for the project.
B. Annually, no later than October 1, the director shall determine prevailing wage rates and prevailing fringe benefit rates to take effect the next January 1 for respective classifications of laborers and mechanics employed on public works projects at the same wage rates and fringe benefit rates used in collective bargaining agreements between labor organizations and their signatory employers that govern predominantly similar classifications of laborers and mechanics for the locality of the public works project and the crafts involved; provided that:
C. The prevailing wage rates and prevailing fringe benefit rates to be paid shall be posted by the contractor or person acting as a contractor in a prominent and easily accessible place at the site of the work; provided that there shall be withheld from the contractor, subcontractor, employer or a person acting as a contractor so much of accrued payments as may be considered necessary by the director or contracting officer of the state or political subdivision to pay to laborers and mechanics employed on the project the difference between the prevailing wage rates and prevailing fringe benefit rates required by the director to be paid to laborers and mechanics on the work and the wage rates and fringe benefit rates received by the laborers and mechanics and not refunded to the contractor, subcontractor, employer or a person acting as a contractor or the contractor's, subcontractor's, employer's or person's agents.

Covered Employees
Where petitioners, an alliance of craft unions representing the interests of thousands of New Mexico employees working on public works projects throughout the state, sought a writ of mandamus ordering the director of the labor relations division of the New Mexico department of workforce solutions (director) to set prevailing wage and prevailing benefit rates in accordance with the Public Works Minimum Wage Act, §§ 13-4-10 to -17 NMSA 1978, mandamus was proper because 13-4-11 NMSA 1978 imposes a mandatory, nondiscretionary duty on the director to set prevailing wage rates and prevailing fringe benefit rates according to collective bargaining agreements for all public works projects costing more than sixty thousand dollars to which the state or any political subdivision is a party. _N.M. Bldg. and Constr. Trades Council v. Dean_, 2015-NMSC-023.
**Section violated.** — Classification of and wage payments to an employee is in violation of this section, when the interpretation and application of standard job classifications and descriptions were not based upon the prevailing wages being paid on contract work of a similar nature to corresponding classes of laborers and mechanics performing the same work as that employee performed. _L.H. Lacy Co. v. State Labor & Indus. Comm'n_, 1976-NMSC-065, 89 N.M. 563, 555 P.2d 684.
**Health benefits are part of prevailing wage.** — The health benefits provided pursuant to Executive Order No. 2007-49, issued on October 25, 2007, titled "State of New Mexico Contractor Health Coverage Requirement", which directs executive branch state agencies that solicit and award contracts after January 1, 2008 to require prospective contractors to offer health care coverage to their New Mexico employees as part of their procurement submittal, is a valid, enforceable contract that may be accounted for as part of the prevailing wage. 2008 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 08-05.
