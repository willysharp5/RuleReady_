Alabama Workplace Safety Requirements (OSHA or state-level)

Overview
| The Survey of Occupational Injuries and Illnesses (SOII) estimates the number and frequency of workplace injuries and illnesses based on logs kept by Alabama employers during the year. The survey includes a sample of approximately 3,900 companies in Alabama. Nonfatal recordable workplace injuries and illnesses are those that result in one or more of the following: loss of consciousness, days away from work, restricted work activity or job transfer, and medical treatment beyond first aid. Each case includes a summary of the illness/injury, along with demographic and case data. SOII estimates provide an indicator of the magnitude of, and trends in, occupational safety and health problems. The estimates can be useful to policymakers, employers, insurance carriers, industrial hygienists, manufacturers of safety equipment, researches, and others concerned with job safety and health. |
| The newest annual study is the OSHA Log Data Collection Survey. It is designed to collect occupational injury and illness data from employers within specific industry and employment size specifications. The information collected is used to focus on OSHA activities including inspections, outreach and consultation and to measure the performance of the agency in meeting its goal of reducing workplace injuries and illnesses. |

Covered Employees
| The Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries (CFOI) is conducted in cooperation with the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This census collects a comprehensive count of work-related fatal injuries, along with descriptive data on their circumstances. The reliability of the census comes from its multiple data sources, such as: death certificates, workers’ compensation records, news media, and OSHA reports. These detailed accounts allow the safety and health community to identify specific life-threatening hazards. CFOI data allows safety and health experts to monitor the number and types of deadly work injuries over time, allowing them to focus on work settings that have particularly high risks. |
