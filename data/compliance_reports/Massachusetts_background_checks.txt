**Can an employer ask me about my criminal history on a job application?**
Probably not. Under the “Ban the Box” law, most employers in Massachusetts are not allowed to ask you about your criminal record on a job application.  There are a few limited exceptions for certain types of jobs in specific industries (for example, jobs at day cares and certain financial institutions) where employers can ask about criminal records on job applications because they are legally prohibited from hiring people with criminal records for those jobs.

In addition, employers that automatically reject all applicants with criminal records may be violating state and federal civil rights laws because using criminal records in this way can have a disproportionate effect on protected groups, including racial minority groups.  To avoid potential liability for civil rights violations, employers should conduct an individualized assessment before determining that a particular criminal record disqualifies an applicant for a particular job.
