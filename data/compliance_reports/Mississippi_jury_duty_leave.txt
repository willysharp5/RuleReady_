Mississippi Jury Duty Leave

Overview
**SERVICE ON A TRIAL -** The number of days that you will serve varies according to the trials scheduled and the number of trials for which you are selected. You may be selected for both criminal and civil cases during your term of service. On the average, jurors serve approximately 1-3 days during a one month term of service. The Judge will adjourn the jury each evening and will instruct you on what time you must return the following morning. You must check in with the Jury Department each morning. The Judge will also indicate on the first day of service how long he/she anticipates the trial to last. If a jury is sequestered (kept together for security purposes), the government will pay all expenses for food and lodging.
**(1) Attendance Fees -** A $40.00 attendance fee is paid for each day you report for duty, whether or not you are selected to serve on a trial. The $40.00 attendance fee must be reported as income for tax purposes. You must keep a record of the amounts you receive as no tax has been withheld and no W-2 forms are furnished. However, you do not need to report travel allowance as income. 1099 forms are furnished only to those jurors who receive $600 or more for attendance in a calendar year, and are mailed in January of the year following jury service.
