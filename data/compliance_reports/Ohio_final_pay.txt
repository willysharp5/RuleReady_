Under Ohio law, an employer can only make deductions from a final paycheck that they are legally required to do – for example, for taxation purposes – or for deductions that the employee has expressly agreed to. This could include charitable contributions, the repayment of a loan, or payments into a regular savings program.
While Ohio does not set a legal requirement that employers must give employees paid vacation days, many companies still offer vacation to their employees. In Ohio, any paid vacation days are considered as a “fringe benefit” for the employee. Consequently, any unused vacation days that the employee is owed at the time they leave the company should be paid in the final paycheck.
