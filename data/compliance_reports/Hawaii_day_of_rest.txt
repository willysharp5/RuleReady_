However, if an employer does provide a break for the purpose of a meal, the period is not compensable if the period is thirty minutes or more and the employee is completely relieved of duty.  Therefore, it is possible to be scheduled at the place of business for 8 1/2 hours with 8 hours of work and one unpaid 30-minute meal period.
