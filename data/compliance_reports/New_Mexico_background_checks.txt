What Should Employers Do?
All child care providers in licensed child care centers and out of school times, licensed child care homes and registered child care homes must have a background check completed every five years. Background checks are conducted in order to identify information in an applicant’s background to determine whether they are eligible to provide child care services. The background check includes state and federal criminal records, sex offender registry, abuse and neglect checks and other reasonably reliable information about an applicant. If an applicant has lived in another state within the past 5 years, we require them to obtain a background check from that state(s). The background check unit will provide the state’s appropriate forms and instructions to the center or home for completing criminal history and abuse and neglect requests. Completion of these requests is essential in preventing delays.
A direct provider can submit a request to transfer their background clearance as long as there not been a separation in employment for more than 180 days by submitting the [ECECD CCDF Transfer Request Form (PDF uploaded Dec. 16, 2022)](https://www.nmececd.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ECECD-CCDF-Transfer-Request-Updated-12.14.22.pdf) must be submitted to: [ececd.bcu@ececd.nm.gov.](mailto:ececd.bcu@ececd.nm.gov)The form can also be mailed or emailed to:
