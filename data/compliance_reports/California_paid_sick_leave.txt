California Paid Sick Leave

Overview
In general terms, starting on January 1, 2024, the law requires employers to provide and allow employees to use at least 40 hours or five days of paid sick leave per year. Before January 1, 2024, an employer could limit an employee’s use to 24 hours or three days during a year.

Special Requirements
The only exception to this general rule is that as of January 1, 2024, local ordinances cannot contradict the state paid sick leave law requirements regarding the lending of paid sick leave, paystub statements, calculation of paid sick leave, providing notice if the leave is foreseeable, timing of payment of paid sick leave, and whether payment of sick leave is required upon termination. If a local ordinance contradicts the state law on these specific topics, the state law prevails over (preempts) the local law.
All employees who work at least 30 days for the same employer within a year in California, including part-time, per diem, in-home supportive services (IHSS) providers, and temporary employees, are covered by this law with some narrow exceptions.
Employees **partially exempt** from the paid sick leave law include employees covered by a qualifying collective bargaining agreement (CBA) with specified provisions. In order for the collective bargaining agreement to partially exempt an employer, the agreement must expressly provide for the wages, hours of work, and working conditions of employees, and expressly provide for paid sick days or a paid leave or paid time off policy that permits the use of sick days for all employees, premium wage rates for all overtime hours worked, and a regular hourly rate of pay of not less than 30 percent more than the state minimum wage rate. Employers with collective bargaining agreements that do not satisfy these specific provisions (and are not otherwise fully exempt) must comply with all of the provisions of the paid sick leave law.

Coverage Election
How employers provide this leave depends on what kind of plan your employer chooses to offer in order to comply with the paid sick leave law.
Yes. An employer may choose to advance sick leave to an employee before it is accrued, but there is no requirement for an employer to do so under this law.

Reciprocity/Extraterritorial Coverage
3. **What if a local ordinance requires an employer to provide more paid sick leave than state law?**
The employer must provide the paid sick leave required by the local ordinance if it is higher than the requirements of state law.

Employer Responsibilities & Deadlines
Starting on January 1, 2024, an employer must allow an employee to use at least five days or 40 hours, whichever is more (refer to [DLSE Opinion Letter](https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/opinions/2015.08.07.pdf) 2015.08.07).
The employer must provide the paid sick leave required by the local ordinance if it is higher than the requirements of state law.
In general, if employees are subject to local sick leave ordinances, the employer must comply with both the local and California laws, which may differ in some respects. The employer must provide the provision or benefit that is most generous to the employee.
The only exception to this general rule is that as of January 1, 2024, local ordinances cannot contradict the state paid sick leave law requirements regarding the lending of paid sick leave, paystub statements, calculation of paid sick leave, providing notice if the leave is foreseeable, timing of payment of paid sick leave, and whether payment of sick leave is required upon termination. If a local ordinance contradicts the state law on these specific topics, the state law prevails over (preempts) the local law.

Employer Notification Requirements
The only exception to this general rule is that as of January 1, 2024, local ordinances cannot contradict the state paid sick leave law requirements regarding the lending of paid sick leave, paystub statements, calculation of paid sick leave, providing notice if the leave is foreseeable, timing of payment of paid sick leave, and whether payment of sick leave is required upon termination. If a local ordinance contradicts the state law on these specific topics, the state law prevails over (preempts) the local law.
Most employers with this policy do not track how much time employees take off or for what reason.  Although the law requires that employers separately track sick leave accrual and use, for employers with unlimited paid time off plans, the notice, itemized pay stub or separate written statement provided with the payment of wages meets this requirement by indicating the paid sick leave is “unlimited”.
3. **Do I have to notify my employer before taking sick leave?**

Posting Requirements
The only exception to this general rule is that as of January 1, 2024, local ordinances cannot contradict the state paid sick leave law requirements regarding the lending of paid sick leave, paystub statements, calculation of paid sick leave, providing notice if the leave is foreseeable, timing of payment of paid sick leave, and whether payment of sick leave is required upon termination. If a local ordinance contradicts the state law on these specific topics, the state law prevails over (preempts) the local law.
Most employers with this policy do not track how much time employees take off or for what reason.  Although the law requires that employers separately track sick leave accrual and use, for employers with unlimited paid time off plans, the notice, itemized pay stub or separate written statement provided with the payment of wages meets this requirement by indicating the paid sick leave is “unlimited”.
The employee must notify the employer in advance if the sick leave is planned, as may be the case with scheduled doctors' visits. If the need is unforeseeable, the employee need only give notice as soon as practical, as may occur in the case of unanticipated illness or a medical emergency.

Recordkeeping Requirements
An _accrual_ policy is one where employees earn sick leave overtime, with the accrued time carrying over in each year of employment. In general terms (and subject to some exceptions), employees under an accrual plan must earn at least one hour of paid sick leave for each 30 hours of work (the 1:30 schedule). Although employers may adopt or keep other types of accrual schedules (other than 1:30), the schedule must result in an employee having at least 24 hours of accrued sick leave or paid time off by the 120th calendar day of employment and 40 hours by the 200th calendar day of employment. If an employer is using the 1 hour of paid sick leave accrued for 30 hours worked or something more generous (e.g. 1 hour accrued of paid sick leave for every 20 hours worked), then the employer does not have to provide 24 hours or 3 days by the 120th day of the year and 40 hours or 5 days by the 200th day. The requirements to provide the minimum amounts by the 120th day and the 200th day of the year are set up as a measure for employers who use other accrual methods so that the plans meet certain minimums.  The measure assumes full-time employment. The 1:30 yields the same results of roughly 24 hours and 40 hours by the 120th day and the 200th day, respectively, for full time workers.
The employer has the choice to frontload the two additional days on January 1, 2024 or move the measurement of the yearly period to January 1, 2024 and frontload five days.  For example, if an employee started on May 1, 2021 and the employer used that anniversary date to frontload 3 days or 24 hours on May 1, 2023, the employer may either provide 2 days or 16 hours on January 1, 2024 and keep the May 1 date to frontload or can “reset” the frontload date to January 1, 2024 and provide the employee 5 days or 40 hours then.
Some plans existing prior to January 1, 2015 are also “grandfathered” in. The “grandfather” clause allows employers with paid sick leave policies or paid time off policies that were in existence prior to January 1, 2015, to maintain those policies and be deemed in compliance as long as they meet the following requirements:

Penalties for Non-Compliance
For example, if an employee covered by a qualifying CBA is denied paid sick leave because they could not find a replacement worker, the employer would be in violation of California’s paid sick leave law and the employee could seek remedies for these violations by filing a claim with the Labor Commissioner’s Office.
Also, if an employee covered by a qualifying CBA is fired because they attempted to use accrued sick days, the employer would be in violation of the anti-retaliation provisions of California’s paid sick leave law. The employee could seek remedies for these violations by filing a retaliation complaint with the Labor Commissioner’s Office.
In addition, for employees partially exempt by a qualifying collective bargaining agreement, an employer is still subject to the anti-retaliation provisions of paid sick leave law and cannot retaliate against an employee for using paid sick leave. For example, if an employer denies holiday pay to an employee because the employee used an accrued sick day for a qualifying purpose the day before or after a holiday, the employer may be in violation of the anti-retaliation provisions of California’s paid sick leave law. The employee could seek remedies for these violations by filing a retaliation complaint with the Labor Commissioner’s Office.
An employer shall not deny an employee the right to use accrued sick days, discharge, threaten to discharge, demote, suspend, or in any manner discriminate against an employee for using accrued sick days, attempting to exercise the right to use accrued sick days, filing a complaint with the department or alleging a violation of this article, cooperating in an investigation or prosecution of an alleged violation of this article, or opposing any policy or practice or act that is prohibited by this article.
