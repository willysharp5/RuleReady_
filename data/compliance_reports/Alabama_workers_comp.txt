###### Contact for additional information
The manner or method by which you choose to insure your workers’ compensation liability is your decision. Should you have any questions contact the Workers’ Compensation Division at 1-800-528-5166 or (334) 956-4044.

Covered Employers
If you regularly employ less than five (5) employees, full-time or part-time and including officers of a corporation in any one business, other than the business of constructing or assisting on-site in the construction of new single-family, detached residential dwellings, the Alabama Workers’ Compensation Law does not require you to have workers’ compensation insurance coverage. Employers of domestic employees, farm laborers, or casual employees and municipalities having a population of less than 2,000 (according to the most recent federal census) are not required to provide coverage but can elect to be covered by the provisions of the Alabama Workers’ Compensation Law. Why should you have workers’ compensation coverage?
Alabama’s Workers’ Compensation Law provides significant and valuable benefit to both employer and employee. The employee is guaranteed a “benefit certain” in the event of an on-the-job injury or occupational disease. The employer pays for this insurance. The employer is protected by the “exclusive remedy” provisions of the Law. This means that an injured worker is entitled only to the benefits required by law, thus the employer’s liability is limited.
