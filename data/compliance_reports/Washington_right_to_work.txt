Overview
### Understanding Workers' Financial Wellbeing in States with Right-to-Work Laws
As public interest in labor unions has increased in recent months, along with an increase in union representation petitions, it is valuable to understand the economic implications of labor unions. [3](http://www.federalreserve.gov/www.federalreserve.gov#fn3) Previous empirical studies on the effects of labor unions and collective bargaining processes have focused on several economic outcomes ranging from workers' pay and productivity to firms' profitability, investments, and overall economic performance. [4](http://www.federalreserve.gov/www.federalreserve.gov#fn4) More broadly, it is important to understand how policies that affect unionization rates also affect individual workers' financial outcomes and wellbeing. In this note, we focus on one of the key legislative interventions that drive some of the differences in union density across US states, namely Right-to-Work (RTW) laws. Specifically, we extend the existing literature on RTW laws by focusing on the effects on financial wellbeing of individuals in states that implement the legislation.

Covered Employers
The passage of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) in 1935 guaranteed workers the right to unionize and collectively bargain over wages, work hours, and other employment benefits. The 1935 legislation also allowed for provisions under which the collective bargaining contracts between firms and labor organizations could require all workers covered under the union to pay union dues. Such contracts are called union security agreements. [9](http://www.federalreserve.gov/www.federalreserve.gov#fn9) However, just over a decade later in 1947, the NLRA was amended by the Taft-Hartley Act, which opened the door for states to supersede the provisions of the NLRA, allowing them to prohibit union security agreements by enacting RTW laws. Specifically, the RTW laws enabled states to remove the requirement for workers to join a labor union and pay the required union representation costs as a condition of their employment. [10](http://www.federalreserve.gov/www.federalreserve.gov#fn10) As a result, under RTW laws, while workers could refuse to join a labor union, they could still enjoy the wage and non-wage benefits from labor unions' collective bargaining. However, achieving workers' benefits can be costly and are typically financed by union dues accrued from union members. [11](http://www.federalreserve.gov/www.federalreserve.gov#fn11) As such, it has been suggested that the implementation of RTW laws can encourage free-ridership while weakening the strength of organized labor. [12](http://www.federalreserve.gov/www.federalreserve.gov#fn12)
The role of RTW laws in curbing the strength of labor unions has prompted extensive academic and political discussions. Proponents of RTW laws argue that passage of such laws support business investments and long-term economic growth. These arguments find support in several studies that show states with "pro-business" RTW laws have seen a substantial growth in private sector employment, especially in manufacturing activity. [15](http://www.federalreserve.gov/www.federalreserve.gov#fn15) Moreover, according to data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, from 1990 to 2011, states with RTW laws saw a much faster growth in overall employment and nominal income levels than non-RTW states. [16](http://www.federalreserve.gov/www.federalreserve.gov#fn16)
Conversely, critics of RTW laws assert that such regulations considerably undermine the wage and non-wage benefits that organized unions could achieve for workers. Corroborating this viewpoint, various studies have documented that the passage of RTW laws is followed by a statistically significant decline in wage income of employees. [17](http://www.federalreserve.gov/www.federalreserve.gov#fn17) Additional research has also found that rates of employer-sponsored pensions and health insurance are lower in states with RTW laws.

Specifically, we extend the existing literature on RTW laws by focusing on the effects on financial wellbeing of individuals in states that implement the legislation.
In general, RTW laws provide workers with the option to opt out of union expenses when working at a unionized establishment. For those who opt out of union membership where RTW laws are in place, workers can avoid the cost of paying union dues or representation fees to maintain their employment status. However, they can still receive the non-excludable benefits of the union's collective bargaining. [5](http://www.federalreserve.gov/www.federalreserve.gov#fn5) The share of unionized workers is typically lower in states with RTW laws than in states where RTW laws have not been enacted. [6](http://www.federalreserve.gov/www.federalreserve.gov#fn6) As shown in Figure 1, the union membership rate in RTW states stood at 6 percent in 2022—less than half of the 13-percent share observed in states without a RTW regulation.

What Should Employers Do?
The passage of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) in 1935 guaranteed workers the right to unionize and collectively bargain over wages, work hours, and other employment benefits. The 1935 legislation also allowed for provisions under which the collective bargaining contracts between firms and labor organizations could require all workers covered under the union to pay union dues.

Training Requirements
Consistent with the BLS data, the union membership rate in the SHED sample is lower in states with RTW regulations than in states without RTW laws. Additionally, occupation categories that tend to be highly unionized such as teaching and education, medical and health care services, protective services, and office and administrative support, were found to have higher rates of unionized workers in the SHED sample than the overall average. [24](http://www.federalreserve.gov/www.federalreserve.gov#fn24)
Notes: Marginal effects from Probit regressions are estimated using sample from SHED surveys 2013-2022. Robust standard errors are clustered on the states and are reported in parentheses. Individual-level controls include marital status, race, ethnicity, education level, family size, number of own children. Regression variables including outcomes and covariates are chosen by ensuring that the relevant data are available across most surveys. State-level control includes political affiliation of governor. All regressions additionally include State and survey year fixed effects. \*\*\* p<0.01, \*\* p<0.05, \* p<0.1.

[12](http://www.federalreserve.gov/www.federalreserve.gov#fn12)
The negative relationship between the passage of RTW laws and the extent of unionization has been well-documented in the relevant literature. Some earlier studies suggest that the lower levels of union membership observed in RTW states might be driven by pre-existing preferences towards unions and region-specific differences in public attitudes rather than the passage of RTW laws themselves. [13](http://www.federalreserve.gov/www.federalreserve.gov#fn13) Overall, these studies indicate that it is important to account for the unobserved effects of prevalent attitudes and simultaneity biases when causally identifying the effects of RTW laws on unionization. In other words, the size of the unionized work force could contribute to the passage of RTW laws rather than the other way around. However, even after controlling for some of the unobserved heterogeneities, Ellwood and Fine (1987) found evidence that passage of a RTW law is followed by a "strong short-run reduction in union organizing," resulting from a decrease in the number of certification elections and a reduction in the average number of workers in each new bargaining unit. As such, Ellwood and Fine's results indicate that RTW laws have a negative impact on the "flow" into union membership, which eventually affects the "stock" of union membership in the long run. The adverse impact of the RTW laws on union density as well as union coverage has been later substantiated by several other studies. [14](http://www.federalreserve.gov/www.federalreserve.gov#fn14)

However, despite the increase in employment, we also find that the passage of a RTW law is followed by a statistically significant decline in annual wages by almost $1,900. This decline amounts to approximately 4 percent of the baseline mean annual wage earnings of $46,267. To avoid potential sample selection issues, these declines are not just for individuals who are working, but all prime-aged adults. One of the underlying reasons behind the decrease in annual earnings could be a reduction in the strength of labor unions in states that pass RTW laws. Along that line of reasoning, we also find that in states that enact RTW laws, the overall union membership rate declines by an average of 2 percentage points during post-implementation years.

Employer Notification Requirements
In this section, we use data from the Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking (SHED) to better understand whether introduction of a RTW legislation is associated with any change in individuals' financial wellbeing. We first use the SHED to compare employment-related outcomes and financial conditions between unionized and non-unionized workers. We utilize the last four annual surveys starting from October 2019 that document information on whether a worker is a member of a union or a similar employee association. We present the relevant summary statistics in Table 1, including information for union workers in highly unionized occupations and union workers in RTW states.
