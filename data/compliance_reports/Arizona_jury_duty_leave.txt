Arizona Jury Duty Leave

Overview
The right is guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution and Arizona Constitution. Specifically, the Arizona Constitution provides, "the right of trial by jury shall remain inviolate." That right to a jury trial requires that persons summonsed for jury service appear and participate. Therefore, as noted on a jury summons, failure to appear as directed may subject you to penalties by law.
If you are not available on the date scheduled, you may postpone the date of your initial appearance for jury service two times only. To request a postponement, follow the instructions in the Juror Affidavit Questionnaire or Summons or contact the court in which you are scheduled to appear. Inconvenience to a prospective trial juror or an employer is not a legal reason to be excused from jury service. However, you may request to be postponed for this reason.

Requests to be excused are infrequently granted. In particular, excuses are not granted on the basis of religious beliefs, moral beliefs, status as business proprietor, professional status as doctor or lawyer, etc. Excuses are granted on the basis that you do not understand English or because jury service would cause you to incur costs that would have a substantial adverse impact on the payment of your necessary daily living expenses or on those for whom you provide regular care. A request to be excused must be made in writing to the court that issued the summons and must be supported by appropriate documentation. Requests for excuse should be directed to the Jury Commissioner's Office.
Since you, as a juror, are an officer of the court, we request that you dress appropriately. Business attire is suggested. The temperature of the jury assembly areas and courtrooms can be unpredictable. Shorts, miniskirts, tank tops, halters, braless dresses or tops, tee-shirts, rubber sandals and other informal attire is not considered appropriate in the courtroom setting. If you should appear wearing these or other items deemed unsuitable for attending court, you may be required to return home at your own expense to change into more suitable attire or your jury service may be rescheduled to another date.

Covered Employees
A member of the Jury Commissioner's staff takes attendance and assigns the proper number of jurors to each division conducting a jury trial. Prospective jurors are selected at random for the individual courtrooms.
Compensation for mileage is the same amount paid to state officers and employees and set by statute.
Anything considered to be a weapon or that is deemed unacceptable by the court security staff will be confiscated and dealt with appropriately. No firearms or edged cutting devices, i.e. straight razors, pocket knives, hunting knives, or butterfly knives are allowed.

If your name is called as being a member of a trial panel, you and other members of the panel will be assigned to a courtroom. You will be instructed where to report and asked to wait in the lobby for instructions from the bailiff. Generally, you will be permitted to return home at the close of the day's session in court. If an emergency arises while you are sitting as a juror, consult the bailiff or judge about your problem. Should you need to get in touch with your family or employer, the bailiff will be happy to assist you.
If there is any disagreement or confusion as to the judge's instructions, or as to their meaning, the jury (through its foreperson) can ask the bailiff for further instructions or assistance from the judge.

This very rarely happens. At the conclusion of the trial, should you be contacted by the lawyers in a case in which you sat as a juror, remember that you are not obligated to divulge any information concerning the deliberations, the verdict, or your opinions about anything concerning the case unless ordered to do so by the court.

Upon retiring to the jury room to deliberate, the jury selects a foreperson. It is the foreperson's duty to act as the presiding officer, to see that the jury's deliberations are conducted in an orderly fashion, and to see that the issues submitted for the jury's consideration are fully and fairly discussed and that every juror has a chance to say what they think about every question. When ballots or votes should be taken, the foreperson should see that this is done. The foreperson should sign any written request made of the judge. A good foreperson can keep the discussion organized, save time and get efficient results.

Penalties for Non-Compliance
