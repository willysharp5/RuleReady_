Covered Employers
Your employer is required to give you up to three successive hours to vote each election day, no matter the size of the employer or the type of the business. You are required to notify your employer before election day that you intend to be absent to vote, and your employer gets to decide the time of the day that you are excused to vote.
Your employer may deduct the time lost from your pay, but may not in any other way discipline or penalize you for this absence.
