Covered Employees

Posters should be permanently posted in a sufficient number of locations at each work site, such as on bulletin boards or near time clocks, so that all employees will have the opportunity to read them. Posters should always be clearly visible and not covered up by other items. One central location will not usually satisfy this requirement unless it is a location which all employees normally use to reach their workstations, to obtain their pay or to eat. If only one location is chosen when several are available, you must notify your workers that the chosen location will be the posting place for all official notices.
If you do not have a permanent work site regularly accessed by your employees, an individual copy is to be provided to each employee.
