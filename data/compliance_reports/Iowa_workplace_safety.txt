In addition, federal OSHA retains enforcement of the anti-retaliation provision of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, Section 11(c), 29 USC 660(c), with respect to the private sector. The State Plan also investigates private and state and local government workplace retaliation cases under a provision analogous to Section 11(c).
Iowa OSHA offers voluntary and cooperative programs focused on reducing injuries, illnesses, and fatalities. On-site consultation services are also available which help employers – both state and local government and private – comply with Iowa OSHA and OSHA standards and identify and correct potential safety and health hazards. For more information on these programs, please visit the Iowa State Plan website.
A three-member Employment Appeal Board is appointed by the governor to represent employers, workers, and the general public. The board serves as an independent administrative adjudicatory body to hear contests of citations, penalties, and abatement periods issued by Iowa OSHA. For more information on these proceedings, please visit the Iowa State Plan website.
