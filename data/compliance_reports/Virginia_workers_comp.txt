For a contractor or other business that hires subcontractors to assist in their trade, business or to complete a contract, the subcontractors’ employees are included when counting the total number of employees to assess when coverage is required.

This requirement applies **regardless** of whether the subcontractor has their own workers’ compensation coverage.

An employer that is not required to carry coverage under the law may obtain coverage voluntarily.
