Wisconsin Pregnancy / Disability / ADA Accommodations

Overview
A reasonable accommodation is any modification or adjustment to a job, an employment practice, or the work environment that makes it possible for a qualified individual to enjoy an equal employment opportunity.
Reasonable accommodations requests are specific to the individual and the position but may include things such as making facilities accessible, adjusting work schedules, restructuring portions of jobs, providing assisting devices or equipment, providing readers or interpreters, and modifying work sites. The employer has the final say in what the accommodation may look like, and accommodations may not always be the exact accommodation requested.
