2. If a truck driver or truck driver’s assistant, in addition to performing offsite delivery work, performs other construction work on the site of the work (“non-delivery construction work”), such as installation or repair work, the worker’s time spent in the non-delivery construction work is covered by Davis-Bacon to the same extent as it would be for any other worker, and the applicable wage rate is the rate for the appropriate classification of the non-delivery construction work being performed.

What Should Employers Do?
