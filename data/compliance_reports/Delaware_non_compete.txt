### CHAPTER 58. Laws Regulating the Conduct of Officers and Employees of the State
#### Subchapter I. State Employees’, Officers’ and Officials’ Code of Conduct

What Should Employers Do?
This subchapter shall be known and may be cited as the “State Employees’, Officers’ and Officials’ Code of Conduct.”
(1) In our democratic form of government, the conduct of officers and employees of the State must hold the respect and confidence of the people. They must, therefore, avoid conduct which is in violation of their public trust or which creates a justifiable impression among the public that such trust is being violated.
(2) To ensure propriety and to preserve public confidence, officers and employees of the State must have the benefit of specific standards to guide their conduct and of some disciplinary mechanisms to guarantee uniform maintenance of those standards. Some standards of this type are so vital to government that violation thereof should subject the violator to criminal penalties.
(4) It is the desire of the General Assembly that all counties, municipalities and towns adopt code of conduct legislation at least as stringent as this act to apply to their employees and elected and appointed officials. This subchapter shall apply to any county, municipality or town and the employees and elected and appointed officials thereof which has not enacted such legislation by January 23, 1993. No code of conduct legislation shall be deemed sufficient to exempt any county, municipality or town from the purview of this subchapter unless the code of conduct has been submitted to the State Ethics Commission and determined by a majority vote thereof to be at least as stringent as this subchapter. Any change to an approved code of conduct must similarly be approved by the State Ethics Commission to continue the exemption from this subchapter.

Training Requirements
(11) “State agency” means any office, department, board, commission, committee, court, school district, board of education and all public bodies existing by virtue of an act of the General Assembly or of the Constitution of the State, excepting only political subdivisions of the State, their agencies and other public agencies not specifically included in this definition which exist by virtue of state law, and whose jurisdiction:
(c) Restrictions on contracting with the State. — No state employee, no state officer and no private enterprise in which a state employee or state officer has a legal or equitable ownership of more than 10% (more than 1% in the case of a corporation whose stock is regularly traded on an established securities market) shall enter into any contract with the State (other than an employment contract) unless such contract was made or let after public notice and competitive bidding. Such notice and bidding requirements shall not apply to contracts not involving more than $2,000 per year if the terms of such contract reflect arms’ length negotiations. For the period of July 1, 1990, through June 30, 1991, nothing in this subsection shall prohibit a state employee, a state officer, or a private enterprise in which a state employee or a state officer has a legal or equitable ownership of more than 10% (more than 1% in the case of a corporation whose stock is regularly traded on an established securities market) from contracting with a public school district and/or the State Board of Education for the transportation of school children without public notice and competitive bidding as is permitted under § 6904(c) of this title.
(d) Post-employment restrictions. — No person who has served as a state employee, state officer or honorary state official shall represent or otherwise assist any private enterprise on any matter involving the State, for a period of 2 years after termination of employment or appointed status with the State, if the person gave an opinion, conducted an investigation or otherwise was directly and materially responsible for such matter in the course of official duties as a state employee, officer or official. Nor shall any former state employee, state officer or honorary state official disclose confidential information gained by reason of public position nor shall the person otherwise use such information for personal gain or benefit.

Training Deadlines
(g) Contracts voidable by court action. — In addition to any other penalty provided by law, any contract entered into by any state agency in violation of this subchapter shall be voidable by the state agency; provided, that in determining whether any court action should be taken to void such a contract pursuant to this subsection, the state agency shall consider the interests of innocent 3rd parties who may be damaged thereby. Any court action to void any transaction must be initiated within 30 days after the state agency involved has, or should have, knowledge of such violation.
(h) Exceptions for transportation contracts with school districts. — Except for transportation supervisors for any school district within this State, nothing in this section shall prohibit an employee or the employee’s spouse or children (natural or adopted) from contracting for the transportation of school children. Such transportation contracts may be entered into by an employee or the employee’s spouse or children without public notice and competitive bidding as is provided in § 6904(c) of this title.
(9) Under circumstances in which the Commission has not convened for 60 or more consecutive days, and after notice to the Commission, Commission Counsel may issue written advisory opinions upon the request of any state employee, state officer, honorary state official or state agency as to the applicability of this chapter to any particular fact situation if the request concerns an issue that does not require a waiver and that has previously been determined by:

Qualified Trainers
