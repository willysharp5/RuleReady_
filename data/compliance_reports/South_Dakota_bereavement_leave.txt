Covered Employees
**Sick leave** may be granted for illness, health care needs, or for the temporary care of the employee, the employee's immediate family, or an individual for whom the employee is the legal guardian. For the loss of an immediate family member, employees may use up to five days of sick leave as bereavement leave. An employee who is on approved leave, except terminal vacation leave, and becomes injured or ill may also use sick leave.
**Vacation leave** may be granted for vacation leave or to supplement other leaves of absence. If an employee works less than 40 hours in a week or takes leave without pay, the number of leave credits earned will be reduced in proportion to the number of hours worked. Upon separation, retirement, or resignation, employees with six months of continuous service will be paid for accumulated vacation leave.
