Covered Employers
(a) Prohibition of Consideration of Criminal History Prior to a Conditional Offer of Employment. Except in the circumstances addressed in subsection (a)(4) below, employers and other covered entities (“employers” for purposes of this section) are prohibited from inquiring into, considering, distributing, or disseminating information related to the criminal history of an applicant until after the employer has made a conditional offer of employment to the applicant.

(3) Employers who violate the prohibition on inquiring into criminal history prior to making a conditional offer of employment may not, after extending a conditional offer of employment, use an applicant's failure to disclose criminal history prior to the conditional offer as a factor in subsequent employment decisions, including denial of the position conditionally offered.

Covered Employees
(1) An arrest or detention that did not result in conviction (Labor Code section 432.7 (see limited exceptions in subdivisions (a)(1) for an arrest for which the employee or applicant is out on bail or on their own recognizance pending trial and (f)(1) for specified positions at health facilities); Government Code section 12952);
(II) Letters from current or former teachers, counselors, supervisors, co-workers, parole or probation officers, or others who know the applicant;
(2) A labor contractor or union hiring hall may not decline to admit a worker to a pool or availability list, discontinue a worker's inclusion in a pool or availability list, or decline to refer a worker to a position with a client employer, because of the worker's criminal history unless the labor contractor or union hiring hall has complied with the procedures and requirements outlined in section 11017.1 of these regulations. To the extent labor contractors or union hiring halls place applicants into a pool of workers from which individuals may be assigned to a variety of positions, the labor contractors or union hiring halls must still comply with the requirements of section 11017.1, including the individualized assessment of whether any conviction history being considered has a direct and adverse relationship with the specific duties of the jobs for which the applicant may be assigned from the pool or hall.
