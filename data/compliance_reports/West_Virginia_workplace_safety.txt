West Virginia Workplace Safety Requirements (OSHA or state-level)

Overview
West Virginia Division of Labor is the enforcing agency for the Occupational Safety and Health Act §21-3A of the West Virginia Code. West Virginia adopted the Federal Occupation Safety and Health Administration's standards that were in effect April 15, 1998 to ensure that state agencies abide by Federal OSHA's regulations to provide a place of employment which is free from recognized hazards which could cause death, serious physical harm, or serious illness to employees. Effective June 16, 2021 this will now include checking state employees that operate cranes on a construction project.
Although the State OSHA program has enforcement authority, we offer compliance assistance by providing an increased awareness to upper management, and training materials for in-house training of employees. We encourage you to visit [www.osha.com](https://www.osha.com/) to learn more about the OSHA regulations your agency is obligated to observe. Please contact us if we can be of assistance in strengthening your workplace safety and health culture.

Covered Employers
3\. Privately interview any employer or employee.
