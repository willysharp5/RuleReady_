Oklahoma Final Pay / Vacation Payout

Overview
"A. Whenever an employee's employment terminates, the employer shall pay the employee's wages in full, less offsets, at the next regular designated payday established for the pay period in which the work was performed either through the regular pay channels or by certified mail postmarked within the deadlines herein specified if requested by the employee, unless provided otherwise by a collective bargaining agreement that covers the employee." (Emphasis added).
"3. 'Wages' means compensation owed by an employer to an employee for labor or services rendered, including salaries, commissions, holiday and vacation pay, overtime pay, severance or dismissal pay, bonuses and other similar advantages agreed upon between the employer and the employee, which are earned and due or provided by the employer to his employees in an established policy, whether the amount is determined on a time, task, piece, commission or other basis of calculation." (Emphasis added).

Covered Employers
"A. Whenever an employee's employment terminates, the employer shall pay the employee's wages in full, less offsets, at the next regular designated payday established for the pay period in which the work was performed either through the regular pay channels or by certified mail postmarked within the deadlines herein specified if requested by the employee, unless provided otherwise by a collective bargaining agreement that covers the employee." (Emphasis added).
¶5 We find that the language of 40 O.S. 165.3 (1984) does not contain an exception involving an employee "terminated for cause." Thus, 40 O.S. 165.3 (1984) does not provide for a different method of determining wages for an employee terminated and an employee terminated "for cause," unless a collective bargaining agreement covering the employer and employee provides for such a difference.

(Emphasis added).

Covered Employees
"If an employee is terminated for cause, is that employee entitled to vacation pay, accrued and unused, at the time of termination?"
"A. Whenever an employee's employment terminates, the employer shall pay the employee's wages in full, less offsets, at the next regular designated payday established for the pay period in which the work was performed either through the regular pay channels or by certified mail postmarked within the deadlines herein specified if requested by the employee, unless provided otherwise by a collective bargaining agreement that covers the employee." (Emphasis added).
¶3 Clearly, an employee is entitled to be paid that employee's wages in full at the time of termination, less offsets, unless otherwise provided by a collective bargaining agreement that covers the employee. If there is no collective bargaining agreement covering the employee, then the employee is entitled to be paid wages in full, less offsets, at the time of termination.

Special Requirements
¶4 The question arises concerning the applicability of this statute to an employee "terminated for cause." A rule of statutory construction is that exceptions should not be read into a statute which are not made by the legislative body. Seventeen Hundred Peoria, Inc. v. City of Tulsa, 422 P.2d 840 (Okl. 1966); Udall v. Udall, 613 P.2d 742 (Okl. 1980).
