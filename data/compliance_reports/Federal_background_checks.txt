Covered Employers
In response to the proposed rule, OPM received 20 comments during the 60-day public comment period from individuals (including Federal employees), organizations, and Federal agencies. At the conclusion of the public comment period, OPM reviewed and analyzed the comments. In general, the comments ranged from categorical rejection of the proposed regulations to strong support. OPM reviewed and carefully considered all comments and arguments made in support of and in opposition to the proposed changes. The comments are summarized below, together with a discussion of the suggestions for revision that were considered and either adopted, adopted in part, or declined, and the rationale therefor. Finally, comments beyond the scope of the proposed changes or which were vague or incomplete are not addressed below.
Several organizations commended OPM for taking steps to implement strong regulations. These organizations stated their support for “the adoption of final regulations that provide additional clarity to both hiring agencies and the public, allow for effective enforcement of the new law, and reinforce the clear language and intent of the Fair Chance Act.” In addition, the organizations expressed gratitude for OPM's commitment to effectively implementing the Fair Chance Act. These organizations also requested that OPM incorporate additional protections and clarifications into the final rule. OPM notes that several public comments resulted in additional clarifications and changes in this final rule. These changes are addressed below in their respective areas of the Supplementary Information section of this preamble. OPM will address other comments in guidance that it will be issuing to assist agencies with implementing the requirements of this rule.
These final implementing regulations resulted from a bipartisan law that enjoyed Congressional support across two Administrations. The scope of OPM's regulations is determined by the contours of the law Congress drafted and directed OPM to implement. As such, OPM will not make any revisions to the rule based on this comment. This regulation prohibits Federal agencies and Federal contractors acting on their behalf from requesting that an applicant for Federal employment disclose criminal history record information before the agency makes a conditional offer of employment to that applicant. This final rule does not eliminate the requirement of agencies performing their due diligence in examining an applicant's criminal history or other relevant background information once a conditional offer of employment has been extended. Further, this regulation improves the government by supporting the Administration's initiative on diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA), further positioning the Federal government as a model employer, and providing opportunities for talented, skilled individuals—both with and without a criminal history record—to put their talents to use to advance the mission of the Federal Government.

Office of Personnel Management.

What Should Employers Do?
The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is issuing final regulations governing when, during the hiring process, a hiring agency can request information typically collected during a background investigation from an applicant for Federal employment. In addition, OPM is issuing new regulations establishing the requirement for the timing of collection of criminal history information and for governing complaint procedures under which an applicant for a position in the civil service may submit a complaint, or any other information, relating to compliance by an employee of an agency in reference to the timing of collection of criminal history information. Furthermore, the final rule outlines adverse action procedures that apply when it is alleged that an agency employee has violated the requirements and appeal procedures that will be available from a determination by OPM adverse to the Federal employee. Nothing in this rule shall be read in derogation of any individual's rights under Title VII. This rule implements the Fair Chance to Compete for Jobs Act of 2019 (Fair Chance Act). With some exceptions, the Fair Chance Act prohibits Federal agencies and Federal contractors acting on their behalf from requesting that an applicant for Federal employment disclose criminal history record information before the agency makes a conditional offer of employment to that applicant. The Fair Chance Act identifies some positions to which the prohibition shall not apply. It also requires OPM to establish complaint procedures under which an applicant for a position in the civil service may submit a complaint, or any other information, relating to compliance with the Fair Chance Act by an employee of an agency, establishes minimum penalties and procedures to be followed before a penalty may be assessed, and requires OPM to establish appeal procedures available in the event of a determination adverse to the Federal employee.
Provisions of the Fair Chance Act were incorporated into the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 ( [Pub. L. 116-92](https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/116/public/92)), which was signed into law by the President on December 20, 2019. The Fair Chance Act places limitations on agency requests for criminal history record information prior to a conditional offer of employment. It also requires a complaint process by which applicants for appointment to a position in the civil service may submit a complaint, or any other information, relating to compliance with the requirements of the Fair Chance Act. Furthermore, the Fair Chance Act establishes requirements and procedures regarding penalties for violations. Because of these statutory requirements, OPM issued proposed regulations published at [87 FR 24885](https://www.federalregister.gov/citation/87-FR-24885), April 27, 2022, pertaining to when, during the hiring process, a hiring agency can request information typically collected during a background investigation from an applicant for Federal employment.
On December 1, 2016, OPM issued a final rule at [81 FR 86555](https://www.federalregister.gov/citation/81-FR-86555) that revised its regulations pertaining to when, during the hiring process, a hiring agency can request information typically collected during a background investigation from an applicant for Federal employment. The changes were to promote compliance with Merit System Principles as well as the goal of the Federal Interagency Reentry Council and the Presidential Memorandum of January 31, 2014, “Enhancing Safeguards to Prevent the Undue Denial of Federal Employment Opportunities to the Unemployed and Those Facing Financial Difficulty Through No Fault of Their Own,” otherwise known as “Ban the Box” rules. As noted by OPM when it first promulgated the rule, the intent of the rule was to conform regulatory requirements to what OPM believed was already the predominant agency practice, as many agencies already employed the practice of waiting until the later stages of the hiring process to collect criminal history information.
Current OPM regulations at [5 CFR parts 330](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-5/part-330) and [731](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-5/part-731) prevent agencies, unless an exception is granted by OPM, from making inquiries into an applicant's criminal or credit history of the sort asked on OPM Optional Form (OF) 306, titled Declaration for Federal Employment, in the \`Background Information' section or other forms used to conduct suitability investigations for Federal employment unless the hiring agency has made a conditional offer of employment to the applicant. The Fair Chance Act contains the same prohibition with respect to criminal history and does not address credit history. The Fair Chance Act has elaborated on the methods of inquiry not permitted and provides for certain exceptions to the rule. Furthermore, the Fair Chance Act requires OPM, when making additional exceptions, to give due consideration to positions that involve interaction with minors, access to sensitive information, or managing financial transactions.

Training Requirements
An organization asserted that the proposed rule provides no guidance about how the investigatory process should handle private or sensitive information that may be disclosed, intentionally or inadvertently, in the course of the fact-gathering and reporting process. The organization recommended that OPM consider analyzing and potentially issuing guidelines or revised rules that would require that the processes to implement the Fair Chance Act requirements are consistent with the intent of the statute and other applicable Federal law concerning privacy and sensitivity of personal information including but not limited to criminal conviction-related history. The commenter also suggested that agencies and OPM take into account local, Tribal, and State privacy and fair chance-type laws when carrying out their investigatory and oversight responsibilities under this rule.
We disagree with the organization's assertion that the rule provides no guidance about the handling of private or sensitive information that may be disclosed, intentionally or inadvertently, in the course of the investigatory process. In the Supplemental Information section of the proposed rule, OPM addressed handling of private or sensitive information by stating that OPM and agencies have obligations under the Privacy Act. Private or sensitive information disclosed during the investigation will be added to the agency's administrative file and is covered by Federal law in accordance with the Privacy Act requirements of this section. Indeed, the regulatory text for § 754.205 states, “The complaint, the applicant's supporting material, the agency's administrative file, the notice of the proposed action, the employee's written reply, if any, any summary or transcript of the employee's oral reply, if any, the notice of decision, and any order to the covered agency effecting the action together with any supporting material, must be maintained in an appropriate system of records under the Privacy Act.”
Several organizations asked that additional instructions be provided to hiring agencies about what actions must be delayed until after a conditional offer and how staff should respond if criminal history information is disclosed before a conditional offer. These organizations also commented that agencies should be directed, within the regulation, to not consider criminal history information that may be inadvertently disclosed earlier in the process or gained through informal attempts, such as through internet searches. OPM believes that part 920 clearly and with significant detail outlines the applicability of the limitations in terms of the means through which agencies may obtain information of this nature and the timing of which they may employ such means. Furthermore, this section requires agencies to publicize this prohibition, when applicable, within the job announcement, giving applicants the opportunity to know that the information is not to be requested ahead of the job offer. Therefore, OPM will not make any changes in this regulation based on these comments; OPM will, however, provide further instructions to agencies on these points in supplemental guidance.

Training Deadlines

Under section 9203, the Fair Chance Act requires the Director of OPM to establish and publish procedures under which an applicant for an appointment to a position in the civil service may submit a complaint, or any other information, relating to compliance by an employee with [5 U.S.C. 9202](https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/9202). Under the provisions of section 9204, the Fair Chance Act further establishes minimum requirements regarding penalties for violations of the Fair Chance Act and provides that such penalties may be entered only after notice to the Federal employee accused and an opportunity for a hearing on the record (thereby, indirectly, establishing minimum procedural requirements before an adverse determination can be made). Finally, the Fair Chance Act requires the Director of OPM, by rule, to establish procedures providing for an appeal from any adverse action taken under section 9204 by no later than 30 days after the date of the action. The Fair Chance Act further notes in section 9205 that an adverse action taken under the Fair Chance Act shall not be subject to the procedures under chapter 75 of title 5 or, except as provided for in the appeal process established under the Fair Chance Act, be subject to appeal or judicial review. Therefore, OPM is issuing final regulations governing complaint procedures under which an applicant for a position in the civil service may submit a complaint, or any other information, relating to compliance by an employee of an agency with section 9202 of title 5, and adverse action and appeal procedures for alleged violations of section 9202 of title 5.
Regarding § 754.102(a), some organizations recommended that OPM develop a centralized means for receiving complaints and forwarding them to the appropriate agency for an agency investigation. Organizations expressed concern that, while the rule requires each hiring agency to establish and publicize systems for receiving complaints from applicants regarding violations of the Fair Chance Act, some job applicants will likely remain confused as to whom to submit such a complaint or may feel more comfortable submitting a complaint directly to OPM instead of to the hiring agency that likely just rejected them for a job based on their criminal history record. These organizations posited that, even if OPM does not implement a centralized means for receiving Fair Chance Act complaints, the regulations should provide that any complaint related to a violation of the Fair Chance Act that is submitted directly to OPM shall be forwarded to the appropriate agency for investigation and will be considered timely if it was submitted to OPM within the time period described in the regulations.

Qualified Trainers
OPM agrees that the Fair Chance Act advances important goals in that it places limitations on actions Federal agencies may take in the hiring process that would be detrimental for individuals who have been incarcerated. OPM's implementing regulations allow job applicants to present their qualifications and abilities for assessment and to be considered solely based on their merits without the specter of a criminal record during the selection process. Consistent with the statute, the regulations provide the opportunity for a qualified applicant with a criminal history record to advance in the hiring process in the same manner as a qualified applicant without a criminal history record.
OPM cannot adopt these suggestions because they are contrary to the text of the Fair Chance Act. The Fair Chance Act makes it unlawful, with few exceptions, to request criminal history from an applicant before the agency makes a conditional offer of employment to that applicant. As discussed, OPM's implementing regulations allow job applicants to present their qualifications and abilities for assessment and be considered based on their merits without the specter of a criminal history record during the selection process. The regulations provide the opportunity for qualified applicants with criminal history records to advance in the hiring process just as a qualified applicant without a criminal history record would advance. Moreover, in most cases, the separate personnel vetting determination can and should occur after the selection process and a conditional offer of employment has been made, thereby separating criminal history as an aspect of the vetting process from factors that are relevant at the time of the initial hiring assessment.

Special Requirements
The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is issuing final regulations governing when, during the hiring process, a hiring agency can request information typically collected during a background investigation from an applicant for Federal employment. In addition, OPM is issuing new regulations establishing the requirement for the timing of collection of criminal history information and for governing complaint procedures under which an applicant for a position in the civil service may submit a complaint, or any other information, relating to compliance by an employee of an agency in reference to the timing of collection of criminal history information. Furthermore, the final rule outlines adverse action procedures that apply when it is alleged that an agency employee has violated the requirements and appeal procedures that will be available from a determination by OPM adverse to the Federal employee. Nothing in this rule shall be read in derogation of any individual's rights under Title VII. This rule implements the Fair Chance to Compete for Jobs Act of 2019 (Fair Chance Act). With some exceptions, the Fair Chance Act prohibits Federal agencies and Federal contractors acting on their behalf from requesting that an applicant for Federal employment disclose criminal history record information before the agency makes a conditional offer of employment to that applicant. The Fair Chance Act identifies some positions to which the prohibition shall not apply. It also requires OPM to establish complaint procedures under which an applicant for a position in the civil service may submit a complaint, or any other information, relating to compliance with the Fair Chance Act by an employee of an agency, establishes minimum penalties and procedures to be followed before a penalty may be assessed, and requires OPM to establish appeal procedures available in the event of a determination adverse to the Federal employee.
Current OPM regulations at [5 CFR parts 330](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-5/part-330) and [731](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-5/part-731) prevent agencies, unless an exception is granted by OPM, from making inquiries into an applicant's criminal or credit history of the sort asked on OPM Optional Form (OF) 306, titled Declaration for Federal Employment, in the \`Background Information' section or other forms used to conduct suitability investigations for Federal employment unless the hiring agency has made a conditional offer of employment to the applicant. The Fair Chance Act contains the same prohibition with respect to criminal history and does not address credit history. The Fair Chance Act has elaborated on the methods of inquiry not permitted and provides for certain exceptions to the rule. Furthermore, the Fair Chance Act requires OPM, when making additional exceptions, to give due consideration to positions that involve interaction with minors, access to sensitive information, or managing financial transactions.
collection of the OF 306 in the application and hiring process; however, unless permitted by law, they may not ask applicants to answer the questions on the form that address criminal history information until a conditional offer of employment has been extended. Further, unless they have been granted an exception by OPM, agencies may not ask individuals to complete the question that relates to credit history. Most applicants are likely to be asked to complete the form after a conditional offer of employment has been made. OPM's authority to direct Federal agencies to use the OF 306 is found in [5 U.S.C. 1302](https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/1302), [3301](https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/3301), [3304](https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/3304), [3328](https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/3328), [7301](https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/7301), and [8716](https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/8716); [5 CFR part 731](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-5/part-731); and [E.O. 10577](https://www.federalregister.gov/executive-order/10577) and [E.O. 13467](https://www.federalregister.gov/executive-order/13467), as amended. The OF 306 is one aspect of vetting that can be collected, in accordance with the provisions outlined in this rule, and used to begin to assess suitability in advance of the initiation of a required background investigation.

OPM is issuing these provisions under section 1122(b)(1) of the Fair Chance Act, under which the Director of OPM “shall issue such regulations as are necessary to carry out [chapter 92 of title 5, United States Code](https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/9201) (as implemented by this subtitle).” OPM is also issuing these provisions to implement the requirements of [5 U.S.C. 9202(c)(2)](https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/9202), as added by the Fair Chance Act, which requires the OPM Director to issue regulations identifying positions with respect to which the prohibition shall not apply giving due consideration to positions that involve interaction with minors, access to sensitive information, or managing financial transactions, beyond those already identified in the statute.

Employer Responsibilities & Deadlines
The OF 306 is used to assist OPM and Federal agencies in determining a person's suitability for employment as well as to provide other information that is required of applicants. Applicants must answer the questions on the form before they can be appointed or converted to a new appointment in the competitive, excepted, or Senior Executive Service. For most of the information on the OF 306, agencies may determine the timing of the
collection of the OF 306 in the application and hiring process; however, unless permitted by law, they may not ask applicants to answer the questions on the form that address criminal history information until a conditional offer of employment has been extended. Further, unless they have been granted an exception by OPM, agencies may not ask individuals to complete the question that relates to credit history. Most applicants are likely to be asked to complete the form after a conditional offer of employment has been made. OPM's authority to direct Federal agencies to use the OF 306 is found in [5 U.S.C. 1302](https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/1302), [3301](https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/3301), [3304](https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/3304), [3328](https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/3328), [7301](https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/7301), and [8716](https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/8716); [5 CFR part 731](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-5/part-731); and [E.O. 10577](https://www.federalregister.gov/executive-order/10577) and [E.O. 13467](https://www.federalregister.gov/executive-order/13467), as amended. The OF 306 is one aspect of vetting that can be collected, in accordance with the provisions outlined in this rule, and used to begin to assess suitability in advance of the initiation of a required background investigation.
Unless otherwise required by law, an employee of an agency may not request, in oral or written form (including through the Declaration for Federal Employment (OF 306) or any similar successor form, the USAJOBS internet website, or any other electronic means) that an applicant for an appointment to a position in the civil service disclose criminal history record information regarding the applicant before the appointing authority extends a conditional offer to the applicant. Under the provisions of the Fair Chance Act, this prohibition does not apply under the following circumstances:
The Fair Chance Act does not specifically address the timing of suitability inquiries into a job applicant's credit history. The Presidential Memorandum on Enhancing Safeguards to Prevent the Undue Denial of Federal Employment Opportunities to the Unemployed and Those Facing Financial Difficulty Through No Fault of Their Own of January 31, 2014, however, addresses credit history, and is still in effect. In accordance with this Memorandum, applicants should not face undue obstacles to Federal employment because they are unemployed or face financial difficulties through no fault of their own. Agencies must take steps to ensure fair treatment of all applicants, as well as Federal employees, throughout the recruiting and hiring process. One of the ways that Federal agencies can ensure fair treatment for applicants who have experienced periods of unemployment and/or financial difficulty is to avoid unnecessary screening mechanisms, especially at early stages of the hiring process, before a candidate's qualifications have been fully assessed. Consistent with existing policy and the Presidential Memorandum, OPM's revision of § 731.103(d)(1) retains the prohibition on making inquiries into a job applicant's credit history and updates the reference to the prohibition relating to criminal history to align with the new part 920, which reflects the requirements of the Fair Chance Act. Both reduce the opportunity for information to be misused at the preliminary screening stage.

Nothing in this rule shall be read in derogation of any individual's rights under Title VII. This rule implements the Fair Chance to Compete for Jobs Act of 2019 (Fair Chance Act). With some exceptions, the Fair Chance Act prohibits Federal agencies and Federal contractors acting on their behalf from requesting that an applicant for Federal employment disclose criminal history record information before the agency makes a conditional offer of employment to that applicant.

It also requires a complaint process by which applicants for appointment to a position in the civil service may submit a complaint, or any other information, relating to compliance with the requirements of the Fair Chance Act. Furthermore, the Fair Chance Act establishes requirements and procedures regarding penalties for violations. Because of these statutory requirements, OPM issued proposed regulations published at [87 FR 24885](https://www.federalregister.gov/citation/87-FR-24885), April 27, 2022, pertaining to when, during the hiring process, a hiring agency can request information typically collected during a background investigation from an applicant for Federal employment.
