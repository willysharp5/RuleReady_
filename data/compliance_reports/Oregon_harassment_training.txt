Training Requirements
The employer should emphasize the importance of its sexual harassment policy through communication and training. Training for staff is essential. Employers should have departmental or unit meetings to explain policies and grievance procedures, so that all employees understand what is prohibited conduct and how to complain about it.
The employer must take "immediate and appropriate corrective action," which means doing whatever is necessary to put a stop to the harassment. Depending on the severity of the harassment, appropriate corrective action could include any of the following: verbal or written warning; counseling; suspension; sensitivity training or education on harassment laws and appropriate workplace conduct; reassignment of workers to different locations or shifts; or dismissal of the harasser.

Employer Notification Requirements
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) Guidelines recommend that employers discuss sexual harassment with employees and express strong disapproval. The employer should develop appropriate sanctions, inform employees of the right to raise complaints and how to raise them, and develop methods to sensitize all concerned.

Posting Requirements
Sexual harassment can take many forms, including repeated sexual flirtations, advances or propositions. It can mean continued or repeated language of a sexual nature, graphic or degrading comments about an individual or his or her appearance, the display of sexually suggestive objects or pictures, or any unwelcome or abusive physical contact of a sexual nature.
Example: Tom, Nicole’s supervisor, regularly compliments her figure and clothing. He frequently walks up behind her and massages her shoulders, despite her objections. On Monday mornings, Tom tells the crew the "dirty joke of the week" from his Saturday night poker game. Other employees laugh, but Nicole usually walks away. Tom also keeps a calendar of semi-nude women posted in his office, despite Nicole's comments that she finds the calendar demeaning. Based on all of the foregoing conduct by Tom, Nicole files a hostile environment sexual harassment claim.

Penalties for Non-Compliance
An employer is automatically liable for sexual harassment by a supervisor when a "tangible employment action" occurs in connection with the harassment. A tangible employment action is very broadly defined and doesn’t have to be negative. Examples include changes in work assignment or schedule, terminations or failure to promote you.
Yes. The policy should define sexual harassment and emphatically state that it is not tolerated. Employers should allow verbal or written complaints, and should provide a grievance procedure that bypasses the immediate supervisor if he or she is the alleged harasser. The policy should also describe the disciplinary actions that may be taken, up to and including termination.
Sexual harassment is defined as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or conduct of a sexual nature (verbal, physical, or visual), that is directed toward an individual because of gender. It can also include conduct that is not sexual in nature but is gender-related. Sexual harassment includes the harassment of the same or of the opposite sex.
