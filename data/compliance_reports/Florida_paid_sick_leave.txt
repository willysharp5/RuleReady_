Paid sick leave is a benefit that allows employees to take time off from work due to illness, injury, or other health-related issues without foregoing pay. The purpose of paid sick leave is to ensure that employees can recover from illness without the financial pressure of losing income. It also helps prevent the spread of contagious diseases in the workplace by encouraging sick employees to stay home.
There are no federal laws in place that mandate the provision of paid sick leave. The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) allows qualified employees to take unpaid leave for certain health conditions.
