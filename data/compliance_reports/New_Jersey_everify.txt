If you request an SSN in Part 2 (Items 13a-17.b) of your Form I-765, and your application is approved, USCIS will electronically transmit that data to the Social Security Administration (SSA), and SSA will assign you a SSN and issue you a Social Security card. SSA will mail your Social Security card directly to the address you provide on Form I-765.
- If you do not request an SSN on your Form I-765, you can apply for an SSN after you receive your EAD from USCIS using the instructions on SSA’s Social Security Number and Card webpage [https://www.ssa.gov/ssnumber/.](https://www.ssa.gov/ssnumber/)

Training Deadlines
- An Asylum Seeker who has Humanitarian Parole and has not submitted form I-589 can apply for an EAD right away. However, if the asylum seeker has filed form I-589, they are eligible to apply for an EAD once the asylum application has been pending for at least 150 days.
