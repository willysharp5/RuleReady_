Colorado Meal & Rest Breaks

Overview
Under the Fair Labor Standards Act ( [FLSA](https://www.dol.gov/general/topic/workhours/breaks)), there are no national requirements for meal breaks. However, states are free to make laws governing labor practices, including required meal breaks. Colorado is one of the states that has defined mandatory break periods for workers.
## Do Colorado Break Laws Differ from Federal Break Laws?

Covered Employers
Employees are not required to take rest periods but employers may not coerce workers to skip them. Rest periods that aren’t taken are considered time worked, so the employee must be paid at their standard rate for them.
In addition to the breaks allowed for all working adults, Colorado law permits [nursing mothers](https://cdle.colorado.gov/sites/cdle/files/INFO%20%237%20Workplace%20Accommodations%20for%20Nursing%20Mothers%2009.05.23%20accessible.pdf) to use reasonable unpaid break time or paid break time for the purpose of pumping breast milk for up to two years after a child’s birth. Employers must make a reasonable effort to provide a private space in proximity to the work area (other than a toilet stall) for this purpose.
Violations to Colorado break laws can result in a compliance order which requires the employer to cease the violation, change policies, and pay extra wages to victims. Employers may also be fined for violations.

However, states are free to make laws governing labor practices, including required meal breaks. Colorado is one of the states that has defined mandatory break periods for workers.
Under the Colorado Overtime and Minimum Pay Standards Order ( [COMPS](https://cdle.colorado.gov/sites/cdle/files/INFO%20%234%20Meal%20and%20Rest%20Periods%205.23.2022%20accessible.pdf)), workers are entitled to one 30 minute meal break period per every five hours worked. This differs from the federal law where a break is not mandatory for any length of shift.
A meal break, according to Colorado law, is a period of 30 minutes that is unpaid, uninterrupted, and duty-free. For every five hours worked, an employee is entitled to a meal break at least one hour after starting or one hour before ending a shift. Certain exemptions to the “uninterrupted and duty-free” statute are possible, when the type of work is impractical. The example given is a car-patrol security guard. He is allowed to exit the car but must remain on the premises while eating his meal. He is still somewhat restricted but also must be paid for that 30 minutes.

Colorado law also requires additional 10-minute rest periods for every four hours worked, rounded up from two hours. (E.g. a two hour, 15-minute shift rounds up to four hours). Multiple 10-minute breaks are allowed for longer shifts. Over six and up to 10 = two breaks; over 11 and up to 14 = three breaks, and so on. Rest periods must be as close to the middle of the work period as possible.
