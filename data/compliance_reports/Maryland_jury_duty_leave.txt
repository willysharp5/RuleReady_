Maryland Jury Duty Leave

Overview
Employers are not obligated to pay their employees while serving jury duty. Some private employers do provide full or partial compensation to their employees for time lost due to serving jury duty. Many county, state, and federal agencies provide administrative leave (or excused leave) for employees called for jury duty in Maryland. You may want to contact your Human Resources Department or Personnel Manual to find out what your employer's policy is pertaining to jury service.
To be eligible for jury duty, you must be at least 18 years of age, a United States citizen, a Maryland resident, and able to read, write, and understand the English language. There are certain exemptions from jury service, which you can learn about by contacting the Jury Commissioner in your county.

Covered Employers
An employer may not deprive an employee of his/her employment solely because of job time lost by the employee as a result of responding to a jury summons or as a result of attending court for service or prospective service as a trial or grand juror.

What Should Employers Do?
There is no automatic exemption for members of the federal or state military services. You may claim such an exemption if your jury service on the date requested would unreasonably interfere with the performance of military duties or affect adversely the readiness of the military unit. The form certifying these requirements must be completed by the commanding officer or supervisor of the person requesting exemption. A copy of the form can be found  here.

A grand jury is made up of 23 people, who receive and hear evidence to determine whether probable cause exists to charge someone with a crime. A grand jury also can conduct its own investigations. Most often, you will be called to serve on a trial jury, generally made up of 12 individuals for criminal trials and 6 for civil trials. A trial jury listens to evidence in a courtroom and determines the facts in a particular case.

Events in a trial usually happen in a particular order, though the order may be changed by the judge. Here is the usual order of events:

Coverage Election
A jury is selected at random from a cross section of the citizens who reside in Maryland. This cross section is drawn from voter registration as well as Motor Vehicle Administration lists, depending on the county where you reside.
After you are sworn in, you and the other potential members of the jury will go through a process known as voir dire, or jury selection. During jury selection, the judge and the lawyers question you and other members of the panel to find out if any of you have any knowledge of the case, a personal interest in the outcome, or any interest in the case that might make it hard for you to be impartial.
