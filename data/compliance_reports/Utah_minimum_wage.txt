There are many areas of agreement between State and Federal child labor law. However, there are some Federal standards that are stricter than Utah law, and if the Federal law applies the employer must comply with the stricter requirement. For example, under Federal law, 14 and 15 year old minors may not work more than three hours on a school day and may not work past 7:00 p.m. from Labor Day to June 1 and past 9:00 p.m. from June 1 to Labor Day. Under Utah state law, minors under the age of 16 may work four hours on a school day, until 9:30 p.m. year around and after 9:30 p.m. if the next day is not a school day. In this example, employers must comply with stricter Federal standards. Please visit the U.S. Department of Labor’s website to compare standards at [www.dol.gov](https://www.dol.gov/).
