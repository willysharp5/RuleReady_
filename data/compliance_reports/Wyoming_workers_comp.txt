Wyoming Workers’ Compensation Requirements

Overview
It is important that we be able to provide timely payments to you for your benefits, and in doing so, are making some changes. Therefore, as of 05/31/2024, you will no longer be able to file your weekly continued claims for payment over the telephone using the automated Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system. You will be able to file your continued claims online at [wyui.wyo.gov](https://wyui.wyo.gov/) by logging in and clicking on **Continued Claim  >  File Continued Claim**.
The Wyoming Department of Workforce Services administers the Workers’ Compensation program, assisting both employees and employers in minimizing the impact of work-related injuries. Whether you’re an injured worker or an employer, we promise we’ll work hard to make the workers’ compensation process as smooth as possible.
