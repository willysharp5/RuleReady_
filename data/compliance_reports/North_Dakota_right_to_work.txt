**§ 34-01-14.1. Collection of actual representation expenses from nonunion employees.** As used in this section, "actual representation expenses" are only those actual expenses which are sustained by a labor union or labor organization in processing any grievance of a nonunion employee. For grievances arising from actions occurring while an employee was a member of a bargaining unit of a management entity with which a labor union or labor organization has a contract, but while that employee was not a member of that union or organization, that labor union or labor organization shall collect actual representation expenses from that nonunion employee. Actual representation expenses may be assessed only in instances in which a nonunion employee has specifically requested in writing to use representation by the labor union or labor organization. A nonunion employee may not be compelled to pay any expenses incurred by a labor union or labor organization in the course of general contract negotiations or collective bargaining. An assessment under this section is not an abridgement of any rights guaranteed under section 34-01-14. This section does not abridge or in any way interfere with rights guaranteed employees generally under the [Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959](http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/29/401.shtml) \[ [29 U.S.C. 401 et seq.](http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/29/401.shtml)\].
