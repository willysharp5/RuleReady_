Submit notification to [dlwdalwarn-labor@maryland.gov](mailto:dlwdalwarn-labor@maryland.gov).

Even if you are an employer facing a layoff or closure event that is not subject to WARN, ESA, or RIF requirements, we still encourage you to notify MD Labor of a dislocation so that your organization and your impacted workers can take advantage of Rapid Response services. This includes larger organizations laying off a small number of people, smaller organizations laying off any number of people, and others.
