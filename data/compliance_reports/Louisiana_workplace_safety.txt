Louisiana Workplace Safety Requirements (OSHA or state-level)

Overview
The occupational health indicators on the **[Health Data Explorer](https://healthdata.ldh.la.gov/)** are a set of surveillance measures used to monitor the health of the Louisiana workforce. Each measure highlights a risk factor or category of injury and illness, usually expressed as the number of occurrences among the relevant population. These measures help to track occurrences over time, comparison between individual states and the nation, and to highlight areas that may need additional exploration. The occupational health measures were created through a joint effort between the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) and the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). For a more detailed description of these measures, please see the **[Glossary of Terms](https://ldh.la.gov/index.cfm/page/2577)**.

Covered Employees
Occupational health surveillance is the tracking of injuries, illnesses, hazards, and exposures that may be occupationally related. Any work place can have hazards that put workers at risk for occupational health injuries and illnesses. Work-related injuries, illnesses, and deaths are largely preventable. The Louisiana Department of Health Occupational Health and Injury Surveillance Program tracks work-related injuries and illnesses in attempts to better understand the underlying issues leading to these conditions in order to implement efforts to reduce these numbers and improve the health and safety of Louisiana work places.
