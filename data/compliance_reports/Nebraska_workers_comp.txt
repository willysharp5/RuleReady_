Nebraska Workers’ Compensation Requirements

Overview
The Nebraska Workers’ Compensation Act (the Act) is found at Section (§) 48-101 to § 48-1,118 of the Nebraska Revised Statutes (laws, written as “Neb. Rev. Stat.”). It provides the only avenue for employees to obtain benefits from their employer for their work-related injuries.
The Act applies to most employees. It does not apply to independent contractors. Most Nebraska employers are required to have workers’ compensation insurance to make sure coverage is in place if employees are injured while working. Exceptions, such as for federal employers, can be found in Neb. Rev. Stat. § 48-106.

See the frequently asked question (FAQ) entitled, “Who is covered by Nebraska workers’ compensation?” The Nebraska Workers’ Compensation Act applies to every nonresident employer performing work in the state, for any length of time, who employs one or more employees in the regular trade, business, profession, or vocation of the employer. Workers’ compensation coverage must be obtained from an insurance company licensed to provide workers’ compensation coverage in Nebraska, unless the employer is authorized to self-insure workers’ compensation liability under Nebraska law.

If an employee is injured by accident or occupational disease arising out of and in the course of their employment, they may be entitled to workers’ compensation benefits. Workers’ compensation insurance covers the risk of an employee getting injured on the job. Workers’ compensation is different and separate from unemployment compensation, Social Security disability benefits, health and accident insurance, or other disability benefit plans provided by the employer.

Training Deadlines
The status of agricultural operations under the Nebraska Workers’ Compensation Act was changed by LB 210 from the 2003 session of the Nebraska Legislature. Employers engaged in an agricultural operation are exempt from providing workers’ compensation insurance coverage if they employ only related employees. Agricultural employers who employ unrelated employees are also exempt unless in a calendar year they employ 10 or more unrelated, full-time employees, on each working day for 13 calendar weeks (consecutive or not). The act applies to an employer 30 days after the 13th week.
Every exempt employer who does not elect to provide workers’ compensation insurance coverage must give all unrelated employees the following written notice at the time of hiring or at any time more than 30 calendar days prior to the time of injury: “In this employment you will not be covered by the Nebraska Workers’ Compensation Act and you will not be compensated under the act if you are injured on the job or suffer an occupational disease. You should plan accordingly.” The notice must be signed by the unrelated employee and retained by the employer. Failure to provide this notice subjects an employer to liability under the act for any unrelated employee to whom such notice was not given.
- Related employee: A spouse of an employer and an employee related to the employer within the third degree by blood or marriage. This includes parents, grandparents, great grandparents, children, grandchildren, great grandchildren, brothers, sisters, uncles, aunts, nephews, nieces, and spouses of the same.

Qualified Trainers
An employer may use the services of a managed care plan that has been certified by the court. However, an employer may not contract directly with a certified managed care plan unless the employer has been approved as a self-insurer by the court. Other employers may use the services of a certified managed care plan that has contracted with the employer’s workers’ compensation insurer or intergovernmental risk management pool. Only a plan that has been certified by the court may be used for workers’ compensation purposes in Nebraska. When a certified managed care plan is used, the employer must give full notice to each covered employee about how to receive services and the rights of the employee under the plan.

Special Requirements
The Act applies to most employees. It does not apply to independent contractors. Most Nebraska employers are required to have workers’ compensation insurance to make sure coverage is in place if employees are injured while working. Exceptions, such as for federal employers, can be found in Neb. Rev. Stat. § 48-106.

Unless an employer is self-insured, it is not permitted to directly pay for medical treatment required under the Nebraska Workers’ Compensation Act. In essence, this would be an attempt by the employer to self-insure its liability for such treatment without first being approved by the court for self-insurance as required in the Act and rules of the court. In addition, the Nebraska legislature has addressed the issue of payment for small medical claims and specifically determined that payment must be made by the insurer, rather than the employer. This is included in [48-146.03](https://www.nebraskalegislature.gov/laws/statutes.php?statute=48-146.03), which provides for a medical deductible option for workers’ compensation insurance policies. That section first establishes such a deductible but then states that the insurer shall pay the entire cost of medical benefits for each claim irrespective of the deductible provision. The insurer is then to be reimbursed by the employer for any deductible amounts paid by the insurer.

Coverage Election
The [Nebraska Workers Compensation Insurance Plan (NWCIP)](https://doi.nebraska.gov/insurers/property-and-casualty) provides workers’ compensation and employers’ liability coverage to employers who are unable to secure coverage through the voluntary market.
An employer exempt from the act may elect to provide workers’ compensation coverage for its employees. Such election is made by the employer obtaining a workers’ compensation insurance policy from an insurer licensed to write workers’ compensation insurance in Nebraska.

Under the Nebraska Workers’ Compensation Act, there are only three methods by which employers may fulfill their obligation to secure payment of compensation:
3. in the case of an employer who is a lessor of one or more commercial motor vehicles leased to a self-insured motor carrier with its principal place of business in Nebraska, by entering into an effective agreement with the self-insured motor carrier that such carrier will pay workers’ compensation benefits to an injured driver. This method will only satisfy the employer’s obligation with respect to drivers. Any obligation with respect to other employees must be satisfied under one of the first two methods.

Employer Notification Requirements

No. The insurer will notify the court when you purchase a policy of workers’ compensation insurance. After receiving proof of coverage from your insurer, if the court has any questions, you may be asked to confirm details about that coverage.
Every exempt employer who does not elect to provide workers’ compensation insurance coverage must give all unrelated employees the following written notice at the time of hiring or at any time more than 30 calendar days prior to the time of injury: “In this employment you will not be covered by the Nebraska Workers’ Compensation Act and you will not be compensated under the act if you are injured on the job or suffer an occupational disease. You should plan accordingly.” The notice must be signed by the unrelated employee and retained by the employer.

### What should an employer do after receiving notice of an on-the-job injury?
The employer should notify its workers’ compensation insurer of the injury or occupational disease. The employer / insurer should file a First Report of Alleged Occupational Injury or Illness with the court within 10 days of the date of the notice of injury. The injured employee is not responsible for filing this report.

Recordkeeping Requirements
### Do I need to file proof of workers’ compensation coverage with the court?
Employers who satisfy certain requirements and have been approved by the court may self-insure. The employer must be a corporation or political subdivision, with a minimum of five years in business under the present organizational structure, have a minimum of 100 employees, a strong financial base, and a positive program for safety. Once approved, a self-insurer must file a surety bond and excess insurance with the court. Any employer not approved by the court must carry a policy of workers’ compensation insurance, or otherwise secure the payment of compensation as required by law.
- Agricultural operation: The cultivation of land for the production of agricultural crops, fruit, or other horticultural products; or the ownership, keeping, or feeding of animals for the production of livestock or livestock products.

Penalties for Non-Compliance
1. A civil fine not to exceed $1,000.00 for each violation. Each day of continued failure to secure coverage constitutes a separate violation.
2. If criminally charged, imprisonment for not more than one year, a $1,000.00 fine, or both.
3. Employers may be enjoined (prohibited) from doing business in Nebraska until compliance is secured, in addition to the civil fine mentioned above.
The Nebraska Workers’ Compensation Act (Act) applies to the State of Nebraska, to every governmental agency created by it, and to every employer in the state employing one or more employees in the regular trade, business, profession, or vocation of the employer. Thus, virtually all employees are covered by the Act, including employees of private industry, state and local government, part-time employees, minors, and employees of charitable organizations. However, employers are not required to provide coverage for independent contractors. At times, there is disagreement on whether a worker is an employee or an independent contractor. While the Act does not define “independent contractor,” case law provides several factors to consider when determining whether a worker is an employee or an independent contractor. This decision is made on a case-by-case basis, and no single factor is determinative.  [The Nebraska Supreme Court applies a 10-factor test when determining whether a worker is an independent contractor or an employee](https://www.newcc.gov/resources/court-forms-and-publications/independent-contractor-or-employee).
