If your employer is not paying you at least the minimum wage, you can file a complaint [online](https://dwd.wisconsin.gov/er/complaints/) or print, sign and mail the [complaint form](https://dwd.wisconsin.gov/dwd/forms/erd/ls-119-e.htm) to our office.

Not specified in available documentation

Special Requirements
The only exception occurs where you requested a deduction for personal reasons. Those deductions may be labeled as "miscellaneous".

Coverage Election
We also allow employers to use electronic pay stubs, provided that you have access to a printer and you are not charged to print the stub each pay period.
Whether an employer must pay for unused benefit pay depends upon the terms of the employer's vacation or resignation policy. Wisconsin employers are not required to provide fringe benefits such as vacation, holiday, or sick pay. When an employer does decide to create a benefit policy, the employer is free to impose any conditions it chooses. Generally, IF the employer implemented a written vacation policy AND it does not include a written forfeit policy, THEN the employer must pay the employee for any earned, unused vacation pay. If you have not been paid for unused vacation and believe you are entitled to this benefit, you can file a complaint [online](https://dwd.wisconsin.gov/er/complaints/) or print, sign and mail the [complaint form](https://dwd.wisconsin.gov/dwd/forms/erd/ls-119-e.htm) to our office.

Reciprocity/Extraterritorial Coverage
- Out-of-state employers in some cases
Employers are required to state clearly on each employee's paycheck, pay envelope, or other accompanying paper the number of hours worked, the rate of pay, and the amount of and reason for each deduction from their wages. A reasonable coding system may be used.

Employer Notification Requirements
You have the right to file a wage claim if there is a dispute with your employer about the amount of wages owed, or if the employer fails to pay wages earned on the regularly scheduled payday. This page provides information about common wage and hour issues.
Union members who wish to file wage claims will be advised by us to file their claims with their local union representatives.
### Payroll Information

Posting Requirements
- Once the complaint is properly filed, the investigator sends a notice and complete copy of the complaint to the business/employer informing it what has been claimed and giving it an opportunity to respond to the claim, by either:
### Is my employer required to give me notice when he fires me? Do I have to give notice when I quit?
Generally, notice is not required by either party. However, notice of quitting may affect payout of fringe benefits like vacation or PTO. It may also affect payout of final wages. If your employer has a policy that requires resignation notice or your final paycheck's rate of pay is reduced if you do not fulfill the notice requirement, and you do not follow the policy after having been made aware of the policy, they may be able to reduce the final paycheck.

Recordkeeping Requirements
You have the right to file a wage claim if there is a dispute with your employer about the amount of wages owed, or if the employer fails to pay wages earned on the regularly scheduled payday. This page provides information about common wage and hour issues.
You can file a complaint [online](https://dwd.wisconsin.gov/er/complaints/) or [paper (to be mailed)](https://dwd.wisconsin.gov/dwd/forms/erd/ls-119-e.htm) with the Division within 2 years of the date the wages were earned, or sue the employer in small claims or circuit court.
You have the right to file a wage claim with us if there is a dispute with the employer about the amount of wages owed. If the employer refuses to pay wages earned on the regularly established payday, you should request payment. If you do not receive payment after 6 days, you may file a claim with us. Once a claim is filed, we will seek to resolve the matter with the employer.

Penalties for Non-Compliance
Employers are only allowed to deduct certain items from an employee's wages, such as taxes, insurance premiums, etc. Employers are not permitted to charge employees for [breakages, cash shortages, fines or any other losses to the business](https://dwd.wisconsin.gov/er/laborstandards/wagededuction.htm), unless you have authorized the deduction in writing after the loss, theft, damage of faulty workmanship, and before the deductions were made.
