Utah Workplace Safety Requirements (OSHA or state-level)

Overview
By the 1950s, two decades before the creation of [Federal OSHA](https://www.osha.gov/), Utah had promulgated standards and safety orders addressing some of the most serious threats to worker’s safety at that time. This proactive approach was again evident in 1973, when Utah enacted the [Utah Occupational Safety and Health Act, Utah Code Ann. §34A-6-101 _et seq.​_](https://le.utah.gov/xcode/Title34A/Chapter6/34A-6.html?v=C34A-6_1800010118000101), giving UOSH the mandate to administer all laws and lawful orders to ensure that every employee in this state has a workplace free of recognized hazards.
According to the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, States can apply for approval to operate their own occupational safety and health programs. Utah started the state plan application and approval process in 1973 and was granted official approval on July 16, 1985. Since that date, occupational safety and health in the state falls under the authority of the State of Utah Labor Commission. There are 26 states and territories considered state plan states in the country. Today, Utah’s commitment to worker safety and health remains as strong as ever.
