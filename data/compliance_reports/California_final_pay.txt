California Final Pay / Vacation Payout

Overview
| | There is no legal requirement in California that an employer provide its employees with either paid or unpaid vacation time. However, if an employer does have an established policy, practice, or agreement to provide paid vacation, then certain restrictions are placed on the employer as to how it fulfills its obligation to provide vacation pay. Under California law, earned vacation time is considered wages, and vacation time is earned, or vests, as labor is performed. For example, if an employee is entitled to two weeks (10 work days) of vacation per year, after six months of work he or she will have earned five days of vacation. Vacation pay accrues (adds up) as it is earned, and cannot be forfeited, even upon termination of employment, regardless of the reason for the termination. (S _uastez v. Plastic Dress Up_ (1982) 31 C3d 774) An employer can place a reasonable cap on vacation benefits that prevents an employee from earning vacation over a certain amount of hours. ( _Boothby v. Atlas Mechanical_ (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1595) And, unless otherwise stipulated by a [collective bargaining agreement](https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/Glossary.asp?Button1=C#collective%20bargaining%20agreement), upon termination of employment all earned and unused vacation must be paid to the employee at his or her final rate of pay. [Labor Code Section 227.3](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=LAB&sectionNum=227.3.) The California Legislature, in order to ensure that vacation plans were fairly and equitably handled, provided that the Labor Commissioner was to "apply the principles of equity and fairness" in resolving vacation claims. |
| | **A.** | Yes. DLSE's enforcement policy does not preclude an employer from providing a specific period of time at the beginning of the employment relationship during which an employee does not earn any vacation benefits. This could apply to a probationary or introductory period, and can even apply to the whole first year of employment. Such a provision in a vacation plan will only be recognized, however, if it is not a subterfuge (phony reason) and in fact, no vacation is implicitly earned or accrued during that first year or other period. For example, a plan with the following provisions would be an obvious subterfuge and not recognized as valid: Year 1: No vacation Year 2: 4 weeks vacation Year 3: 2 weeks vacation The four weeks' vacation earned in the second year, when viewed in the context of the two weeks' vacation earned in the third year, makes it clear that two of the four weeks earned in year two are actually vacation earned in year one. A valid vacation plan could look like the following: Year 1: No vacation Year 2: 2 weeks vacation Year 3: 3 weeks vacation Years 4 through 10: 4 weeks vacation In those instances where a "waiting period" (Year 1 in the examples above) is found to be a subterfuge, employees who separate from their employment during the "waiting period" will be entitled to prorated vacation pay at their final rate of pay. On the other hand, where the employer's vacation plan has a valid "waiting period" provision, employees who separate from their employment during that period will be ineligible for any vacation pay. |

| | **A.** | In California, because paid vacation is a form of wages, it is earned as labor is performed. An employer's vacation plan may provide for the earning of vacation benefits on a day-by-day, by the week, by the pay period, or some other period basis. For example, an employer's policy may provide that an employee will earn a proportionate share of his or her annual vacation entitlement for each week of a calendar year in which the employee either works at least one full day or receives at least one full days' pay during such week. Thus, for example, if an employee is entitled to two weeks (10 work days) annual vacation, and works full-time, eight hours per day, 40 hours per week, in the above example for each week the employee works at least one full day, he or she will earn 1.538 hours of paid vacation, calculated as follows: 10 work days entitlement per year x 8 hours/day = 80 hours vacation entitlement per year 80 hours vacation entitlement per year ÷ 52 weeks per year = 1.538 hours of vacation earned per week In contrast to how vacation pay may be earned, the calculation of vacation pay for terminating employees (a quit, discharge, death, end of contract, etc.) who have earned and accrued and unused vacation on the books at the time of termination must be prorated on a daily basis and must be paid at the final rate of pay in effect as of the date of the separation. For example, an employee who is entitled to three weeks of annual vacation (15 work days entitlement per year x 8 hours/day = 120 hours vacation entitlement per year) who quits on August 7, 2002 (the 219th day of the year) without having taken any vacation in 2002, who has no vacation carry-over from prior years, and whose final rate of pay is $13.00 per hour, would be entitled to $936.00 vacation pay upon separation, calculated as follows: Pro rata daily basis: 219 days (August 7, 2002, date of quit) ÷ 365 days/year = 60% 60% of 120 hours vacation entitlement = 72 hours vacation earned and accrued through August 7, 2002 Vacation days used in 2002 = 0 Vacation earned but not taken at time of separation = 72 hours 72 hours x $13.00/hour = $936.00 vacation pay due at separation. |

| | **A.** | Yes, such a provision would be acceptable to the Labor Commissioner. Unlike "use it or lose it" policies, a vacation policy that places a "cap" or "ceiling" on vacation pay accruals is permissible. Whereas a "use it or lose it" policy results in a forfeiture of accrued vacation pay, a "cap" simply places a limit on the amount of vacation that can accrue; that is, once a certain level or amount of accrued vacation is earned but not taken, no further vacation or vacation pay accrues until the balance falls below the cap. The time periods involved for taking vacation must, of course, be reasonable. If implementation of a "cap" is a subterfuge to deny employees vacation or vacation benefits, the policy will not be recognized by the Labor Commissioner. DLSE has repeatedly found vacation policies which provide that all vacation must be taken in the year it is earned (or in a very limited period following the accrual period) are unfair and will not be enforced by the Division. |
| | **A.** | No, a "paid time off" (PTO) plan or policy does not allow your employer to circumvent the law with respect to vacations. Where an employer replaces its separate arrangements for vacation and sick leave with a program whereby employees are granted a certain number of "paid days off" each year that can be used for any purpose, including vacation and sick leave, the employees have an absolute right to take these days off. Consequently, again applying the principles of equity and fairness, DLSE takes the position that such a program is subject to the same rules as other vacation policies. Thus, for example, the "paid time off" is earned on a day-by-day basis, vested paid time off days cannot be forfeited, the number of earned and accrued paid time off days can be capped, and if an employee has earned and accrued paid time off days that have not been used at the time the employment relationship ends, the employee must be paid for these days. |

Employer Notification Requirements
| | **A.** | After your claim is completed and filed with a local office of the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement (DLSE), it will be assigned to a Deputy Labor Commissioner who will determine, based upon the circumstances of the claim and information presented, how best to proceed. Initial action taken regarding the claim can be referral to a conference or hearing, or dismissal of the claim. If the decision is to hold a conference, the parties will be notified by mail of the date, time and place of the conference. The purpose of the conference is to determine the validity of the claim, and to see if the claim can be resolved without a hearing. If the claim is not resolved at the conference, the next step usually is to refer the matter to a hearing or dismiss it for lack of evidence. At the hearing the parties and witnesses testify under oath, and the proceeding is recorded. After the hearing, an Order, Decision, or Award (ODA) of the Labor Commissioner will be served on the parties. Either party may appeal the ODA to a civil court of competent jurisdiction. The court will set the matter for trial, with each party having the opportunity to present evidence and witnesses. The evidence and testimony presented at the Labor Commissioner's hearing will not be the basis for the court's decision. In the case of an appeal by the employer, DLSE may represent an employee who is financially unable to afford counsel in the court proceeding. See the [Policies and Procedures of Wage Claim Processing](https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/Policies.htm) pamphlet for more detail on the wage claim procedure. |

Under California law, earned vacation time is considered wages, and vacation time is earned, or vests, as labor is performed. For example, if an employee is entitled to two weeks (10 work days) of vacation per year, after six months of work he or she will have earned five days of vacation. Vacation pay accrues (adds up) as it is earned, and cannot be forfeited, even upon termination of employment, regardless of the reason for the termination. (S _uastez v. Plastic Dress Up_ (1982) 31 C3d 774) An employer can place a reasonable cap on vacation benefits that prevents an employee from earning vacation over a certain amount of hours. ( _Boothby v. Atlas Mechanical_ (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1595) And, unless otherwise stipulated by a [collective bargaining agreement](https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/Glossary.asp?Button1=C#collective%20bargaining%20agreement), upon termination of employment all earned and unused vacation must be paid to the employee at his or her final rate of pay. [Labor Code Section 227.3](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=LAB&sectionNum=227.3.) The California Legislature, in order to ensure that vacation plans were fairly and equitably handled, provided that the Labor Commissioner was to "apply the principles of equity and fairness" in resolving vacation claims. |
| | **A.** | Under California law, unless otherwise stipulated by a [collective bargaining agreement](https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/Glossary.asp?Button1=C#collective%20bargaining%20agreement), whenever the employment relationship ends, for any reason whatsoever, and the employee has not used all of his or her earned and accrued vacation, the employer must pay the employee at his or her final rate of pay for all of his or her earned and accrued and unused vacation days. [Labor Code Section 227.3.](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=LAB&sectionNum=227.3.) Because paid vacation benefits are considered wages, such pay must be included in the employee's final paycheck. |
| | **A.** | You can either [file a wage claim](https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/HowToFileWageClaim.htm) with the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement (the Commissioner's Office), or you can file a lawsuit in court against your employer to recover the lost wages. Additionally, if you no longer work for this employer, you can make a claim for the waiting time penalty pursuant to [Labor Code Section 203](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=LAB&sectionNum=203.). |

| **12.** | **Q.** | **What is the procedure that is followed after I file a wage claim?** |
| | **A.** | After your claim is completed and filed with a local office of the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement (DLSE), it will be assigned to a Deputy Labor Commissioner who will determine, based upon the circumstances of the claim and information presented, how best to proceed. Initial action taken regarding the claim can be referral to a conference or hearing, or dismissal of the claim. If the decision is to hold a conference, the parties will be notified by mail of the date, time and place of the conference. The purpose of the conference is to determine the validity of the claim, and to see if the claim can be resolved without a hearing. If the claim is not resolved at the conference, the next step usually is to refer the matter to a hearing or dismiss it for lack of evidence. At the hearing the parties and witnesses testify under oath, and the proceeding is recorded. After the hearing, an Order, Decision, or Award (ODA) of the Labor Commissioner will be served on the parties. Either party may appeal the ODA to a civil court of competent jurisdiction. The court will set the matter for trial, with each party having the opportunity to present evidence and witnesses. The evidence and testimony presented at the Labor Commissioner's hearing will not be the basis for the court's decision. In the case of an appeal by the employer, DLSE may represent an employee who is financially unable to afford counsel in the court proceeding. See the [Policies and Procedures of Wage Claim Processing](https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/Policies.htm) pamphlet for more detail on the wage claim procedure. |
