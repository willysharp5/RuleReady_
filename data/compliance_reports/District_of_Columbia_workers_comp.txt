District of Columbia Workers’ Compensation Requirements

Overview
The goal of the Public Sector Workers' Compensation Program is to respond to District government employee workplace injuries with the best, most appropriate medical care at a reasonable cost, and to return employees back to work as soon as medically possible. Workers' Compensation is a system of benefits provided by law for workers who have job-related injuries or illnesses. Benefits are paid for injuries or illnesses that were caused by an employee's work. The District of Columbia's Office of Risk Management self-administers all Public Sector Workers' Compensation Claims.
