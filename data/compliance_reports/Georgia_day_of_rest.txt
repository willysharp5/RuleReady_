Georgia Day-of-Rest / Predetermined Break Laws

Overview
The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA or Act) requires covered employers to pay employees a minimum wage and, for employees who work more than 40 hours in a week, overtime premium pay of at least 1.5 times the employee's regular rate of pay. Section 13(a)(1) of the FLSA, which was included in the original Act in 1938, exempts from the minimum wage and overtime pay requirements “any employee employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity\[.\]” \[ [1](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-1-p32842)\] The exemption is commonly referred to as the “white-collar” or executive, administrative, or professional (EAP) exemption. The statute expressly gives the Secretary of Labor (Secretary) authority to define and delimit the terms of the exemption. Since 1940, the regulations implementing the EAP exemption have generally required that each of the following three tests must be met: (1) the employee must be paid a predetermined and fixed salary that is not subject to reduction because of variations in the quality or quantity of work performed (the salary basis test); (2) the amount of salary paid must meet a minimum specified amount (the salary level test); and (3) the employee's job duties must primarily involve executive, administrative, or professional duties as defined by the regulations (the duties test). The employer bears the burden of establishing the applicability of the exemption.\[ [2](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-2-p32842)\] Job titles and job descriptions do not determine EAP exemption status, nor does merely paying an employee a salary.
Consistent with its broad authority under the Act, in this final rule the Department is setting compensation thresholds for the standard test and the highly compensated employee test that will work effectively with the respective duties tests to better identify who is employed in a bona fide EAP capacity for purposes of determining exemption status under the Act. Specifically, the Department is setting the standard salary level at the 35th percentile of weekly earnings of full-time salaried workers in the lowest-wage Census Region ($1,128 per week or $58,656 annually for a full-year worker) \[ [3](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-3-p32842)\] and the highly compensated employee total annual compensation threshold at the annualized weekly earnings of the 85th percentile of full-time salaried workers nationally ($151,164). These compensation thresholds are firmly grounded in the authority that the FLSA grants to the Secretary to define and delimit the EAP exemption, a power the Secretary has exercised for 85 years.

Covered Employers
The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA or Act) requires covered employers to pay employees a minimum wage and, for employees who work more than 40 hours in a week, overtime premium pay of at least 1.5 times the employee's regular rate of pay. Section 13(a)(1) of the FLSA, which was included in the original Act in 1938, exempts from the minimum wage and overtime pay requirements “any employee employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity\[.\]” \[ [1](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-1-p32842)\] The exemption is commonly referred to as the “white-collar” or executive, administrative, or professional (EAP) exemption. The statute expressly gives the Secretary of Labor (Secretary) authority to define and delimit the terms of the exemption. Since 1940, the regulations implementing the EAP exemption have generally required that each of the following three tests must be met: (1) the employee must be paid a predetermined and fixed salary that is not subject to reduction because of variations in the quality or quantity of work performed (the salary basis test); (2) the amount of salary paid must meet a minimum specified amount (the salary level test); and (3) the employee's job duties must primarily involve executive, administrative, or professional duties as defined by the regulations (the duties test). The employer bears the burden of establishing the applicability of the exemption.\[ [2](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-2-p32842)\] Job titles and job descriptions do not determine EAP exemption status, nor does merely paying an employee a salary.
The new standard salary level will, in combination with the standard duties test, better define and delimit which employees are employed in a bona fide EAP capacity. By setting a salary level above what the methodology used in 2004 and 2019 would produce using current data, the new standard salary level will ensure that, consistent with the Department's historical approach to the exemption, fewer lower-paid white-collar employees who perform significant amounts of nonexempt work are included in the exemption. At the same time, by setting the salary level below what the methodology used in 2016 would produce using current data, the new standard salary level will allow employers to continue to use the exemption for many lower-paid white-collar employees who were made exempt under the 2004 standard duties test. The combined result will be a more effective test for determining who is employed in a bona fide EAP capacity. The applicability date of the new standard salary level will be January 1, 2025. The Department is not finalizing its proposal to apply the standard salary level to the U.S. territories subject to the federal minimum wage and to update the special salary levels for American Samoa and the motion picture industry.\[ [9](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-9-p32843)\]
Table 25. As explained in section V.B.4.ii, for 1.8 million of the affected employees (including the 1 million impacted by the initial update), this rule will restore overtime protections that they would have been entitled to under every rule prior to the 2019 rule. The Department also estimates that 292,900 employees who are currently exempt under the HCE test, but do not meet the standard test for exemption, will be affected by the proposed increase in the HCE total annual compensation level. Absent an employer increasing these employees' pay to at or above the new HCE level, the exemption status of these employees will turn on the standard duties test (which these employees do not meet) rather than the minimal duties test that applies to employees earning at or above the HCE threshold. The economic analysis quantifies the direct costs resulting from this rule: (1) regulatory familiarization costs; (2) adjustment costs; and (3) managerial costs. The Department estimates that total annualized direct employer costs over the first 10 years will be $803 million with a 7 percent discount rate. This rule will also give employees higher earnings in the form of transfers of income from employers to employees. The

Covered Employees
The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA or Act) requires covered employers to pay employees a minimum wage and, for employees who work more than 40 hours in a week, overtime premium pay of at least 1.5 times the employee's regular rate of pay. Section 13(a)(1) of the FLSA, which was included in the original Act in 1938, exempts from the minimum wage and overtime pay requirements “any employee employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity\[.\]” \[ [1](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-1-p32842)\] The exemption is commonly referred to as the “white-collar” or executive, administrative, or professional (EAP) exemption. The statute expressly gives the Secretary of Labor (Secretary) authority to define and delimit the terms of the exemption. Since 1940, the regulations implementing the EAP exemption have generally required that each of the following three tests must be met: (1) the employee must be paid a predetermined and fixed salary that is not subject to reduction because of variations in the quality or quantity of work performed (the salary basis test); (2) the amount of salary paid must meet a minimum specified amount (the salary level test); and (3) the employee's job duties must primarily involve executive, administrative, or professional duties as defined by the regulations (the duties test). The employer bears the burden of establishing the applicability of the exemption.\[ [2](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-2-p32842)\] Job titles and job descriptions do not determine EAP exemption status, nor does merely paying an employee a salary.
Consistent with its broad authority under the Act, in this final rule the Department is setting compensation thresholds for the standard test and the highly compensated employee test that will work effectively with the respective duties tests to better identify who is employed in a bona fide EAP capacity for purposes of determining exemption status under the Act. Specifically, the Department is setting the standard salary level at the 35th percentile of weekly earnings of full-time salaried workers in the lowest-wage Census Region ($1,128 per week or $58,656 annually for a full-year worker) \[ [3](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-3-p32842)\] and the highly compensated employee total annual compensation threshold at the annualized weekly earnings of the 85th percentile of full-time salaried workers nationally ($151,164). These compensation thresholds are firmly grounded in the authority that the FLSA grants to the Secretary to define and delimit the EAP exemption, a power the Secretary has exercised for 85 years.
The increase in the standard salary level to the 35th percentile of weekly earnings of full-time salaried workers in the lowest-wage Census Region better fulfills the Department's obligation under the statute to define and delimit who is employed in a bona fide EAP capacity. Upon reflection, the Department has determined that its rulemakings over the past 20 years, since the Department simplified the test for the EAP exemption in 2004 by replacing the historic two-test system for determining exemption status with the single standard test, have vacillated between two distinct approaches: One used in rules in 2004 \[ [4](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-4-p32842)\] and 2019,\[ [5](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-5-p32842)\] that exempted lower-paid workers who historically had been entitled to overtime because they did not meet the more detailed duties requirements of the test that was in place from 1949 to 2004; and one used in a rule in 2016,\[ [6](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-6-p32842)\] that restored overtime protection to lower-paid white-collar workers who performed significant amounts of nonexempt work but also removed from the exemption other lower-paid workers who historically were exempt because they met the prior more detailed duties test, an approach that received unfavorable treatment in litigation.\[ [7](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-7-p32842)\] Having grappled with these different approaches to setting the standard salary level, this final rule retains the simplified standard test, the benefits of

What Should Employers Do?
The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA or Act) requires covered employers to pay employees a minimum wage and, for employees who work more than 40 hours in a week, overtime premium pay of at least 1.5 times the employee's regular rate of pay. Section 13(a)(1) of the FLSA, which was included in the original Act in 1938, exempts from the minimum wage and overtime pay requirements “any employee employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity\[.\]” \[ [1](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-1-p32842)\] The exemption is commonly referred to as the “white-collar” or executive, administrative, or professional (EAP) exemption.

The employer bears the burden of establishing the applicability of the exemption.\[ [2](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-2-p32842)\] Job titles and job descriptions do not determine EAP exemption status, nor does merely paying an employee a salary.

The Department is also increasing the earnings threshold for the highly compensated employee (HCE) exemption, which was added to the regulations in 2004 and applies to certain highly compensated employees and combines a much higher annual compensation requirement with a minimal duties test. The HCE test's primary purpose is to serve as a streamlined alternative for very highly compensated employees because a very high level of compensation is a strong indicator of an employee's exempt status, thus eliminating the need for a detailed duties analysis.\[ [10](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-10-p32843)\] The Department is increasing the HCE total annual compensation threshold to the annualized weekly earnings amount of the 85th percentile of full-time salaried workers nationally ($151,164). The new HCE threshold is high enough to reserve the test for those employees who are “at the very top of \[the\] economic ladder” \[ [11](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-11-p32843)\] and will guard against the unintended exemption of workers who are not bona fide EAP employees, including those in high-income regions and industries. The applicability date of the new HCE total annual compensation threshold will be January 1, 2025.
the 2019 rule methodologies), resulting in a $844 per week standard salary level and a $132,964 HCE total annual compensation threshold. Future updates to the standard salary level and HCE total annual compensation threshold with current earnings data will begin 3 years after the date of the initial update (July 1, 2027), and every 3 years thereafter, using the methodologies in place at the time of the updates. The Department anticipates that, by the time the first triennial update under the updating mechanism occurs, assuming the Department has not engaged in further rulemaking, the new methodologies for the standard salary level and HCE total annual compensation requirement established by this final rule will have become effective and the triennial update will employ these new methodologies. The new updating mechanism will allow for the timely, predictable, and efficient updating of the earnings thresholds.

Training Requirements
The public comment period for the NPRM concluded on November 7, 2023. The Department received approximately 33,300 comments in response to the NPRM during the 60-day comment period.\[ [91](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-91-p32847)\] Comments came from a diverse array of stakeholders, including employees, employers, trade associations, small business owners, labor unions, advocacy groups, nonprofit organizations, law firms, academics, educational organizations and representatives, religious organizations, economists, members of Congress, state and local government officials, tribal representatives, and other interested members of the public. All timely received comments may be viewed on the
Alliance for Chemical Distribution; Growmark Comment Campaign (GROWMARK); National Cotton Ginners Association; National Golf Course Owners Association. Reporting on the results of a survey taken of its members, Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) stated that its members “support a reasonable increase to the rule's minimum salary threshold . . . as only 4% of the total number of respondents indicated that they would not support any increase.” Independent Sector remarked that “a healthy and equitable nonprofit workforce requires an increase in the salary threshold beyond $35,568.”
Similarly, the Department declined to adopt automatic updating in the 2019 rule because it “believe\[d\] that it is important to preserve the Department's flexibility to adapt to different types of circumstances,” \[ [138](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-138-p32857)\] and not because it lacked authority to do so. While the Department decided not to institute an updating mechanism in its 2019 rule, it never said that it lacked the statutory authority to do so. Upon further consideration, the Department concludes that the best way to ensure the standard salary level and HCE total compensation threshold remain up to date is a triennial updating mechanism that maintains the Department's flexibility to adapt to different circumstances and change course as necessary.

Training Deadlines
Consistent with its broad authority under the Act, in this final rule the Department is setting compensation thresholds for the standard test and the highly compensated employee test that will work effectively with the respective duties tests to better identify who is employed in a bona fide EAP capacity for purposes of determining exemption status under the Act. Specifically, the Department is setting the standard salary level at the 35th percentile of weekly earnings of full-time salaried workers in the lowest-wage Census Region ($1,128 per week or $58,656 annually for a full-year worker) \[ [3](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-3-p32842)\] and the highly compensated employee total annual compensation threshold at the annualized weekly earnings of the 85th percentile of full-time salaried workers nationally ($151,164). These compensation thresholds are firmly grounded in the authority that the FLSA grants to the Secretary to define and delimit the EAP exemption, a power the Secretary has exercised for 85 years.
The 2019 rule (1) raised the standard salary level from the 2004 salary level of $455 to $684 per week, the equivalent of the 20th percentile of weekly earnings of full-time salaried workers in the lowest-wage Census Region (the South) and/or in the retail industry nationally; (2) increased the HCE total annual compensation threshold from $100,000 to $107,432, the equivalent of the 80th percentile of annual earnings of full-time salaried workers nationwide; (3) allowed employers to credit nondiscretionary bonuses and incentive payments (including commissions) paid at least annually to satisfy up to 10 percent of the standard salary level; and (4) established special salary levels for all U.S. territories.\[ [69](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-69-p32846)\] The 2019 rule did not make changes to the standard duties test.\[ [70](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-70-p32846)\] While using the same methodology used in the 2004 rule to set the salary threshold, the Department did not assert that this methodology constituted the outer limit for defining and delimiting the salary threshold. Rather, the Department reasoned the 2004 methodology was well-established, reasonable, would minimize uncertainty and potential legal challenge, and would address the concerns of the district court that the 2016 rule over-emphasized the salary level.\[ [71](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-71-p32846)\] The Department acknowledged that the new standard salary level was, unlike the salary level set in the 2004 rule, below the long test salary level used in the pre-2004 two-test system.\[ [72](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-72-p32846)\] As in its 2004 rule, the Department “reaffirm\[ed\] its intent to update the standard salary level and HCE total annual compensation threshold more regularly in the future using notice-and-comment rulemaking.” \[ [73](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-73-p32846)\] The 2019 rule took effect on January 1, 2020.\[ [74](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-74-p32846)\]
As explained in greater detail in section V.B, setting the standard salary level at the 35th percentile of weekly earnings of full-time salaried workers in the lowest-wage Census Region ($1,128 per week, $58,656 annually), which is below the midpoint between the long and short tests, will work effectively with the standard duties test to better define and delimit the EAP exemption, in part by more effectively accounting for the switch from a two-test to a one-test system, and will reasonably distribute the impact of the shift by ensuring overtime protection for some lower-salaried employees without excluding from exemption too many white-collar employees solely based on their salary level.\[ [99](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-99-p32848)\] The new standard salary level will also account for earnings growth since the 2019 rule and fully restore the historical screening function of the salary level test. At the same time, the duties test will continue to determine exemption status for a large majority of all salaried white-collar employees subject to the part 541 regulations.

Qualified Trainers
“found no satisfactory substitute for the salary tests.” \[ [151](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-151-p32863)\] To set the salary levels, the Department considered data collected during 1955 WHD investigations on the “actual salaries paid” to employees who “qualified for exemption” (
The CPS MORG data do not capture information about job duties. Therefore, the Department used probability estimates of passing the duties test by occupational title to estimate the number of workers passing the duties test. This is the same methodology used in recent part 541 rulemakings, and the Department believes it continues to be the best available methodology. The probabilities of passing the duties test are from an analysis performed by WHD in 1998 in response to a request from the GAO. Because WHD enforces the FLSA's overtime requirements and regularly assesses workers' exempt status, WHD was uniquely qualified to provide the analysis. The analysis was originally published in the GAO's 1999 white-collar exemptions report.\[ [325](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-325-p32895)\]

Special Requirements
Consistent with its broad authority under the Act, in this final rule the Department is setting compensation thresholds for the standard test and the highly compensated employee test that will work effectively with the respective duties tests to better identify who is employed in a bona fide EAP capacity for purposes of determining exemption status under the Act. Specifically, the Department is setting the standard salary level at the 35th percentile of weekly earnings of full-time salaried workers in the lowest-wage Census Region ($1,128 per week or $58,656 annually for a full-year worker) \[ [3](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-3-p32842)\] and the highly compensated employee total annual compensation threshold at the annualized weekly earnings of the 85th percentile of full-time salaried workers nationally ($151,164). These compensation thresholds are firmly grounded in the authority that the FLSA grants to the Secretary to define and delimit the EAP exemption, a power the Secretary has exercised for 85 years.
The new standard salary level will, in combination with the standard duties test, better define and delimit which employees are employed in a bona fide EAP capacity. By setting a salary level above what the methodology used in 2004 and 2019 would produce using current data, the new standard salary level will ensure that, consistent with the Department's historical approach to the exemption, fewer lower-paid white-collar employees who perform significant amounts of nonexempt work are included in the exemption. At the same time, by setting the salary level below what the methodology used in 2016 would produce using current data, the new standard salary level will allow employers to continue to use the exemption for many lower-paid white-collar employees who were made exempt under the 2004 standard duties test. The combined result will be a more effective test for determining who is employed in a bona fide EAP capacity. The applicability date of the new standard salary level will be January 1, 2025. The Department is not finalizing its proposal to apply the standard salary level to the U.S. territories subject to the federal minimum wage and to update the special salary levels for American Samoa and the motion picture industry.\[ [9](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-9-p32843)\]
To address this problem, in the 2004 and 2019 rules the Department expressed its commitment to regularly updating the salary levels.\[ [13](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-13-p32843)\] In the 2016 rule, it included a regulatory provision to automatically update the salary levels.\[ [14](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-14-p32843)\] Based on its long experience with updating the salary levels, the Department has determined that adopting a regulatory provision for updating the salary levels to reflect current earnings data, with an exception for pausing future updates under certain conditions, is the most viable and efficient way to ensure the EAP exemption earnings thresholds keep pace with changes in employee pay and thus remain effective in helping determine exemption status. This rule establishes a new updating mechanism. The initial update to the standard salary level and the HCE total annual compensation threshold will take place on July 1, 2024, and will use the methodologies in place at that time (

Coverage Election
The initial update on July 1, 2024 and the change in the standard salary level and HCE total annual compensation methodologies on January 1, 2025 will result in two increases in the compensation thresholds within a 12-month period. The Department recognizes that for some employers both changes to the compensation thresholds may occur in the same budget year. Because both the amount of the initial update and the subsequent increase to the thresholds are set forth in this final rule, some employers may choose to make a single adjustment at the first date that encompasses both the initial update and the impending change to the standard salary level and the HCE total annual compensation threshold.\[ [130](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-130-p32855)\]
In 1940, the Department maintained the $30 per week salary level for executive employees but established a higher $200 per month salary level test for administrative and professional employees. In selecting these thresholds, the Department used salary surveys from Federal and state government agencies, experience gained under the National Industrial Recovery Act, and Federal government salaries to determine the salary level that was a reasonable “dividing line” between employees performing exempt and nonexempt work.\[ [148](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-148-p32862)\]

Reciprocity/Extraterritorial Coverage
The exemption for executive, administrative, or professional employees was included in the original FLSA legislation passed in 1938.\[ [18](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-18-p32844)\] It was modeled after similar provisions contained in the earlier National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933 and state law precedents.\[ [19](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-19-p32844)\] As the Department has explained in prior rules, the EAP exemption is premised on two policy considerations. First, the type of work exempt employees perform is difficult to standardize to any time frame and cannot be easily spread to other workers after 40 hours in a week, making enforcement of the overtime provisions difficult and generally precluding the potential job expansion intended by the FLSA's time-and-a-half overtime premium.\[ [20](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-20-p32844)\] Second, exempt workers typically earn salaries well above the minimum wage and are presumed to enjoy other privileges to compensate them for their long hours of work. These include, for example, above-average fringe benefits and better opportunities for advancement, setting them apart from nonexempt workers entitled to overtime pay.\[ [21](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-21-p32844)\]
Section 13(a)(1) exempts covered EAP employees from both the FLSA's minimum wage and overtime requirements. However, because of their long hours of work, its most significant impact is its exemption of these employees from the Act's overtime protections, as discussed in section VII.C.4. An employer may employ such exempt employees for any number of hours in the workweek without paying an overtime premium. Some state laws have stricter standards to be exempt from state minimum wage and overtime protections than those which exist under federal law, such as higher salary levels or more stringent duties tests. The FLSA does not preempt any such stricter state standards.\[ [22](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-22-p32844)\] If a state establishes a higher standard than the provisions of the FLSA, the higher standard applies in that state.

Employer Responsibilities & Deadlines
The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA or Act) requires covered employers to pay employees a minimum wage and, for employees who work more than 40 hours in a week, overtime premium pay of at least 1.5 times the employee's regular rate of pay. Section 13(a)(1) of the FLSA, which was included in the original Act in 1938, exempts from the minimum wage and overtime pay requirements “any employee employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity\[.\]” \[ [1](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-1-p32842)\] The exemption is commonly referred to as the “white-collar” or executive, administrative, or professional (EAP) exemption. The statute expressly gives the Secretary of Labor (Secretary) authority to define and delimit the terms of the exemption. Since 1940, the regulations implementing the EAP exemption have generally required that each of the following three tests must be met: (1) the employee must be paid a predetermined and fixed salary that is not subject to reduction because of variations in the quality or quantity of work performed (the salary basis test); (2) the amount of salary paid must meet a minimum specified amount (the salary level test); and (3) the employee's job duties must primarily involve executive, administrative, or professional duties as defined by the regulations (the duties test). The employer bears the burden of establishing the applicability of the exemption.\[ [2](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-2-p32842)\] Job titles and job descriptions do not determine EAP exemption status, nor does merely paying an employee a salary.
The increase in the standard salary level to the 35th percentile of weekly earnings of full-time salaried workers in the lowest-wage Census Region better fulfills the Department's obligation under the statute to define and delimit who is employed in a bona fide EAP capacity. Upon reflection, the Department has determined that its rulemakings over the past 20 years, since the Department simplified the test for the EAP exemption in 2004 by replacing the historic two-test system for determining exemption status with the single standard test, have vacillated between two distinct approaches: One used in rules in 2004 \[ [4](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-4-p32842)\] and 2019,\[ [5](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-5-p32842)\] that exempted lower-paid workers who historically had been entitled to overtime because they did not meet the more detailed duties requirements of the test that was in place from 1949 to 2004; and one used in a rule in 2016,\[ [6](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-6-p32842)\] that restored overtime protection to lower-paid white-collar workers who performed significant amounts of nonexempt work but also removed from the exemption other lower-paid workers who historically were exempt because they met the prior more detailed duties test, an approach that received unfavorable treatment in litigation.\[ [7](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-7-p32842)\] Having grappled with these different approaches to setting the standard salary level, this final rule retains the simplified standard test, the benefits of
The Department's part 541 regulations have consistently looked to the duties performed by the employee and the salary paid by the employer in determining whether an individual is employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity. Since 1940, the Department's implementing regulations have generally required each of the following three prongs to be satisfied for the exemption to apply: (1) the employee must be paid a predetermined and fixed salary that is not subject to reduction because of variations in the quality or quantity of work performed (the salary basis test); (2) the amount of salary paid must meet a minimum specified amount (the salary level test); and (3) the employee's job duties must primarily involve executive, administrative, or professional duties as defined by the regulations (the duties test).
As previously indicated, to satisfy the EAP exemption, employees must meet certain tests regarding their job duties \[ [76](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-76-p32847)\] and generally must be paid on a salary basis at least the amount specified in the regulations.\[ [77](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-77-p32847)\] Some employees, such as doctors, lawyers, teachers, and outside sales employees, are not subject to salary tests.\[ [78](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-78-p32847)\] Others, such as academic administrative personnel and computer employees, are subject to special, contingent earning thresholds.\[ [79](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-79-p32847)\] The standard salary level for the EAP exemption is currently $684 per week (equivalent to $35,568 per year), and the total annual compensation level for highly compensated employees under the HCE test is currently $107,432.\[ [80](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-80-p32847)\] A special salary level of $455 per week currently applies to employees in Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the CNMI; \[ [81](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-81-p32847)\] a special salary level of $380 per week applies to employees in American Samoa; \[ [82](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-82-p32847)\] and employers can pay a special weekly “base rate” of $1,043 per week to employees in the motion picture producing industry.\[ [83](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-83-p32847)\] Nondiscretionary bonuses and incentive payments (including commissions) paid on an annual or more frequent basis may be used to satisfy up to 10 percent of the standard or special salary levels.\[ [84](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-84-p32847)\]

## SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
The 2019 rule (1) raised the standard salary level from the 2004 salary level of $455 to $684 per week, the equivalent of the 20th percentile of weekly earnings of full-time salaried workers in the lowest-wage Census Region (the South) and/or in the retail industry nationally; (2) increased the HCE total annual compensation threshold from $100,000 to $107,432, the equivalent of the 80th percentile of annual earnings of full-time salaried workers nationwide; (3) allowed employers to credit nondiscretionary bonuses and incentive payments (including commissions) paid at least annually to satisfy up to 10 percent of the standard salary level; and (4) established special salary levels for all U.S. territories.\[ [69](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-69-p32846)\] The 2019 rule did not make changes to the standard duties test.\[ [70](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-70-p32846)\] While using the same methodology used in the 2004 rule to set the salary threshold, the Department did not assert that this methodology constituted the outer limit for defining and delimiting the salary threshold. Rather, the Department reasoned the 2004 methodology was well-established, reasonable, would minimize uncertainty and potential legal challenge, and would address the concerns of the district court that the 2016 rule over-emphasized the salary level.\[ [71](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-71-p32846)\] The Department acknowledged that the new standard salary level was, unlike the salary level set in the 2004 rule, below the long test salary level used in the pre-2004 two-test system.\[ [72](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-72-p32846)\] As in its 2004 rule, the Department “reaffirm\[ed\] its intent to update the standard salary level and HCE total annual compensation threshold more regularly in the future using notice-and-comment rulemaking.” \[ [73](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-73-p32846)\] The 2019 rule took effect on January 1, 2020.\[ [74](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-74-p32846)\]
On September 8, 2023, consistent with its statutory authority to define and delimit the EAP exemption, the Department published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) to revise the part 541 regulations.\[ [88](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-88-p32847)\] The Department proposed to increase the standard salary level to the 35th percentile of weekly earnings of full-time salaried workers in the lowest-wage Census Region (currently the South), equivalent to $1,059 per week based on earnings data used in the NPRM.\[ [89](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-89-p32847)\] The Department also proposed to apply this updated standard salary level to the four U.S. territories that are subject to the federal minimum wage—Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the CNMI—and to update the special salary levels for American Samoa and the motion picture industry in relation to the new standard salary level.\[ [90](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-90-p32847)\] The Department additionally proposed raising the HCE test's total annual compensation requirement to the annual equivalent of the 85th percentile of weekly earnings of full-time salaried workers nationally, equivalent to $143,988 per year based on earnings data used in the NPRM. Finally, the Department proposed a new mechanism to update the standard salary level and the HCE total annual compensation threshold every 3 years to ensure that they remain effective tests for exemption.

On September 8, 2023, consistent with its statutory authority to define and delimit the EAP exemption, the Department published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) to revise the part 541 regulations.\[ [88](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-88-p32847)\] The Department proposed to increase the standard salary level to the 35th percentile of weekly earnings of full-time salaried workers in the lowest-wage Census Region (currently the South), equivalent to $1,059 per week based on earnings data used in the NPRM.\[ [89](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-89-p32847)\] The Department also proposed to apply this updated standard salary level to the four U.S. territories that are subject to the federal minimum wage—Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the CNMI—and to update the special salary levels for American Samoa and the motion picture industry in relation to the new standard salary level.\[ [90](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-90-p32847)\] The Department additionally proposed raising the HCE test's total annual compensation requirement to the annual equivalent of the 85th percentile of weekly earnings of full-time salaried workers nationally, equivalent to $143,988 per year based on earnings data used in the NPRM.

once every 4 years) through notice and comment rulemaking.\[ [107](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-107-p32850)\] While that proposed commitment was not adopted in the 2019 final rule, the Department reaffirmed the importance of, and its commitment to, regular updates in its 2019 final rule. The Department's 2019 final rule in no way suggested that increases to the part 541 earnings thresholds should occur only after some longer period of time.

Recordkeeping Requirements
To address this problem, in the 2004 and 2019 rules the Department expressed its commitment to regularly updating the salary levels.\[ [13](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-13-p32843)\] In the 2016 rule, it included a regulatory provision to automatically update the salary levels.\[ [14](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-14-p32843)\] Based on its long experience with updating the salary levels, the Department has determined that adopting a regulatory provision for updating the salary levels to reflect current earnings data, with an exception for pausing future updates under certain conditions, is the most viable and efficient way to ensure the EAP exemption earnings thresholds keep pace with changes in employee pay and thus remain effective in helping determine exemption status. This rule establishes a new updating mechanism. The initial update to the standard salary level and the HCE total annual compensation threshold will take place on July 1, 2024, and will use the methodologies in place at that time (
The goal of this rulemaking is to set effective earnings thresholds to help define and delimit the FLSA's EAP exemption. To achieve this goal, the Department is not only updating the single standard salary level to account for earnings growth since the 2019 rule, but also to build on the lessons learned in its most recent rulemakings to more effectively define and delimit employees employed in a bona fide EAP capacity. To this end, the Department is finalizing its proposed changes to the standard salary level and the HCE test's total annual compensation requirement methodologies. Additionally, to maintain the effectiveness of these tests, the Department is finalizing an updating mechanism that will update these earnings thresholds to reflect current wage data, initially on July 1, 2024 and every 3 years thereafter. The Department's response to commenter feedback on the specific proposals included in the NPRM is provided in section V. This section explains the need for the Department to update the part 541 earnings thresholds and addresses commenter feedback on whether the earnings thresholds established in the 2019 rule should be increased.
As the Department has explained,\[ [100](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-100-p32848)\] earnings thresholds in the part 541 regulations gradually lose their effectiveness as the salaries paid to nonexempt employees rise over time. These impacts grow in the absence of increases to the salary threshold that keep pace with wage growth. Moreover, the longer it takes for the Department to implement such increases, the larger the increases must be to restore earning thresholds to maintain their effectiveness. More than 4 years have passed since the 2019 final rule established the current earnings thresholds. In the intervening years, salaried workers in the U.S. economy have experienced a rapid growth in their nominal wages, such that the current $684 per week salary level now corresponds to approximately the 12th percentile of earnings of full-time salaried workers in the lowest-wage Census Region and retail nationally. The longer the Department waits to update these earnings thresholds, the less effective they become in helping define

Penalties for Non-Compliance
The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA or Act) requires covered employers to pay employees a minimum wage and, for employees who work more than 40 hours in a week, overtime premium pay of at least 1.5 times the employee's regular rate of pay. Section 13(a)(1) of the FLSA, which was included in the original Act in 1938, exempts from the minimum wage and overtime pay requirements “any employee employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity\[.\]” \[ [1](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-1-p32842)\] The exemption is commonly referred to as the “white-collar” or executive, administrative, or professional (EAP) exemption. The statute expressly gives the Secretary of Labor (Secretary) authority to define and delimit the terms of the exemption. Since 1940, the regulations implementing the EAP exemption have generally required that each of the following three tests must be met: (1) the employee must be paid a predetermined and fixed salary that is not subject to reduction because of variations in the quality or quantity of work performed (the salary basis test); (2) the amount of salary paid must meet a minimum specified amount (the salary level test); and (3) the employee's job duties must primarily involve executive, administrative, or professional duties as defined by the regulations (the duties test). The employer bears the burden of establishing the applicability of the exemption.\[ [2](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-2-p32842)\] Job titles and job descriptions do not determine EAP exemption status, nor does merely paying an employee a salary.
Consistent with its broad authority under the Act, in this final rule the Department is setting compensation thresholds for the standard test and the highly compensated employee test that will work effectively with the respective duties tests to better identify who is employed in a bona fide EAP capacity for purposes of determining exemption status under the Act. Specifically, the Department is setting the standard salary level at the 35th percentile of weekly earnings of full-time salaried workers in the lowest-wage Census Region ($1,128 per week or $58,656 annually for a full-year worker) \[ [3](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-3-p32842)\] and the highly compensated employee total annual compensation threshold at the annualized weekly earnings of the 85th percentile of full-time salaried workers nationally ($151,164). These compensation thresholds are firmly grounded in the authority that the FLSA grants to the Secretary to define and delimit the EAP exemption, a power the Secretary has exercised for 85 years.
The increase in the standard salary level to the 35th percentile of weekly earnings of full-time salaried workers in the lowest-wage Census Region better fulfills the Department's obligation under the statute to define and delimit who is employed in a bona fide EAP capacity. Upon reflection, the Department has determined that its rulemakings over the past 20 years, since the Department simplified the test for the EAP exemption in 2004 by replacing the historic two-test system for determining exemption status with the single standard test, have vacillated between two distinct approaches: One used in rules in 2004 \[ [4](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-4-p32842)\] and 2019,\[ [5](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-5-p32842)\] that exempted lower-paid workers who historically had been entitled to overtime because they did not meet the more detailed duties requirements of the test that was in place from 1949 to 2004; and one used in a rule in 2016,\[ [6](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-6-p32842)\] that restored overtime protection to lower-paid white-collar workers who performed significant amounts of nonexempt work but also removed from the exemption other lower-paid workers who historically were exempt because they met the prior more detailed duties test, an approach that received unfavorable treatment in litigation.\[ [7](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-7-p32842)\] Having grappled with these different approaches to setting the standard salary level, this final rule retains the simplified standard test, the benefits of
The new standard salary level will, in combination with the standard duties test, better define and delimit which employees are employed in a bona fide EAP capacity. By setting a salary level above what the methodology used in 2004 and 2019 would produce using current data, the new standard salary level will ensure that, consistent with the Department's historical approach to the exemption, fewer lower-paid white-collar employees who perform significant amounts of nonexempt work are included in the exemption. At the same time, by setting the salary level below what the methodology used in 2016 would produce using current data, the new standard salary level will allow employers to continue to use the exemption for many lower-paid white-collar employees who were made exempt under the 2004 standard duties test. The combined result will be a more effective test for determining who is employed in a bona fide EAP capacity. The applicability date of the new standard salary level will be January 1, 2025. The Department is not finalizing its proposal to apply the standard salary level to the U.S. territories subject to the federal minimum wage and to update the special salary levels for American Samoa and the motion picture industry.\[ [9](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-9-p32843)\]
