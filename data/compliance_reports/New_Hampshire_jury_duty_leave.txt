### How to contact the Jury Center:

Covered Employers
We all recognize that jury service places a significant burden on you by interrupting your personal and business lives and imposing substantial financial hardship on some. It also represents a unique privilege we have as citizens to meaningfully participate in the judicial system. Jury service not only represents a responsibility but also a unique opportunity to ensure fairness in the justice system, to learn firsthand how it works, and to help us make it work better.
If the juror who has been summoned is deceased, please call the call center at 1-855-212-1234 within our business hours of 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., press 4 and ask for the jury center when your call is answered.
What happens if my employer doesn't want me to be a juror?

Covered Employees
The information contained on this website will provide you with important details about your jury service. You should review it carefully. If you have any questions, court personnel will be pleased to answer them.
Please be assured that the judges and court staff will make certain you are not inconvenienced any more than necessary consistent with your duties as jurors. On behalf of the judges and staff at the Superior Court, thank you for your commitment and effort in representing the citizens of New Hampshire.
An employer cannot ask that an employee be excused or deferred. That request must come from the juror directly. According to [New Hampshire law (RSA 500-A:14)](http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/LI/500-A/500-A-14.htm), an employer cannot deprive an individual of their employment or threaten or coerce an employee because of their jury service. Any employer who violates this law may be held in contempt of court. If an employee were to be discharged because of their jury service, they would have the right to bring the employer to court and recover their job, lost wages and attorney fees. Please contact the Jury Center at 1-855-207-8888 if you have any concerns.
