Covered Employees
1\. Q: How does an employer count employees in order to determine coverage under the HFLL?
A: The law applies to an employer who employs **one hundred or more** employees for each working day during each of twenty or more calendar weeks in the current or preceding calendar year.
- The employee count to determine “one hundred or more” includes all workers or employees on the payroll who work within the State of Hawaii, including:

What Should Employers Do?
A: An employee is a person who performs services for at least six consecutive months for wages under any contract of hire, written or oral, expressed or implied, with an employer, including a full-time, part-time, temporary, casual, on-call or intermittent worker.  Unlike the federal FMLA, there is no requirement in the HFLL that an employee work a minimum number of hours within the six-month period.
3\. Q:  Can an employer require an employee to designate a portion or all of the family leave period to be paid using the employee’s vacation even if the employee wanted to use their sick leave?
A:  It is the employee who may elect to substitute any of the employee’s accrued paid leaves, including but not limited to vacation, personal, or family leave for any part of the four-week period of family leave.  The employer cannot require an employee to use a specific leave for family leave purposes unless required by policy (see answers to questions 11 & 12).
4\. Q:  Is an employer who does not provide sick leave now required to have a sick leave policy?

Special Requirements
A:  It is the employee who may elect to substitute any of the employee’s accrued paid leaves, including but not limited to vacation, personal, or family leave for any part of the four-week period of family leave.  The employer cannot require an employee to use a specific leave for family leave purposes unless required by policy (see answers to questions 11 & 12).
5\. Q:  If an employer’s sick leave plan provides less than 10 days of paid benefits, is the employer required to add additional sick leave days for employees to use for family leave purposes?
7\. Q:  If an employee uses all of his/her sick leave for his/her own disability, must an employer later provide additional days for him/her to use for family leave purposes?

Coverage Election
A:  It is the employee who may elect to substitute any of the employee’s accrued paid leaves, including but not limited to vacation, personal, or family leave for any part of the four-week period of family leave.  The employer cannot require an employee to use a specific leave for family leave purposes unless required by policy (see answers to questions 11 & 12).
A:  No.  HFLL specifies that an employer must permit an employee to use up to 10 days of accrued and available sick leave for family leave purposes. If the employer’s policy has no similar requirement for the use of sick leave for the employee’s own illness, the sick leave is considered “accrued and available”, and the employer must permit the employee to use the sick leave for family leave.  The HFLL also provides that, except for the ten days provided at the election of the employee, the employee may substitute other paid leaves, such as vacation, for any part of the four-week period of family leave.

HFLL – Hawaii Family Leave Law (State law)
- The employee count to determine “one hundred or more” includes all workers or employees on the payroll who work within the State of Hawaii, including:

Employer Responsibilities & Deadlines
A:  It is the employee who may elect to substitute any of the employee’s accrued paid leaves, including but not limited to vacation, personal, or family leave for any part of the four-week period of family leave.  The employer cannot require an employee to use a specific leave for family leave purposes unless required by policy (see answers to questions 11 & 12).
4\. Q:  Is an employer who does not provide sick leave now required to have a sick leave policy?
A:  HFLL does not require employers to create a sick leave plan if they do not currently provide sick leave to employees.  Further, if an employer does not provide paid sick leave to certain employees, such as on-call or part-time workers, the employer is not required to extend paid sick leave to those employees.
5\. Q:  If an employer’s sick leave plan provides less than 10 days of paid benefits, is the employer required to add additional sick leave days for employees to use for family leave purposes?

Employer Notification Requirements
16\. Q:  If an employee does not request paid sick leave for family leave, does an employer have to notify the employee of the right to use sick leave for family leave?
A:  DLIR believes that an employer who provides paid sick leave should notify its employees of their right to use up to 10 days of sick leave for family leave so that employees are aware of that option.

Posting Requirements
Not specified in available documentation

Recordkeeping Requirements
(2) All employees maintained on the payroll, including part-time, temporary or intermittent employees, regardless of their months of service or eligibility for the employer’s benefit plan;
A: No . Employers who are self-insured must pay TDI benefits to a disabled employee in accordance with the actual plan that was filed and approved by DLIR.  HFLL does not provide that an employer diminish an employee’s accrued and available sick leave below the amount required under its TDI plan.
24\. Q:  The employer’s TDI plan provides for a combined sick leave and statutory TDI policy that provides benefits through an authorized TDI carrier upon exhaustion of the employee’s sick leave benefits.  The employer has filed this TDI plan with the DLIR and received approval of this partially self-insured plan. Can the employee utilize his/her sick leave benefits for his/her family members?

Penalties for Non-Compliance
A:  If the PTO can be used for any purpose, it would fall within the definition of sick leave under HFLL, and the employer would be required to permit an employee to use up to 10 days of PTO for family leave.  The employer’s requirement to use PTO before an extended sick leave bank becomes available would not be a violation of the HFLL.
