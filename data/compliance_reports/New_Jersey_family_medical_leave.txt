If you already have a debit card from a previous Temporary Disability, Family Leave, or Unemployment Insurance claim, we will use that same card to pay benefits for new claims.

Covered Employers
- [For Employers](https://www.nj.gov/labor/myleavebenefits/employer/index.shtml)
Family Leave Insurance provides New Jersey workers cash [benefits](https://www.nj.gov/labor/myleavebenefits/help/glossary/index.shtml#Benefits) to bond with a newborn, newly adopted, newly placed foster child, or to provide care for a seriously ill or injured [loved one](https://www.nj.gov/labor/myleavebenefits/help/glossary/index.shtml#FamilyMember). While most New Jersey workers who take family leave are covered under the State’s family leave program, some employers provide Family Leave Insurance through a plan with a private insurance carrier instead. If you are not sure about your coverage, ask your employer.

If you are not sure about your coverage, ask your employer.
You can apply for Family Leave Insurance benefits [online](https://secure.dol.state.nj.us/fli/FLI_Introduction.aspx), [in the mail, or by fax](https://www.nj.gov/labor/myleavebenefits/worker/application/index.shtml). Instructions for filing your claim are included in the application. Read all the instructions carefully before completing the application. If filing by mail or fax, don’t forget to sign and date the form.

What Should Employers Do?
1. **Apply online.** It’s faster than printing and mailing or faxing your application to us. If you are filing for family caregiving, it also allows your family member's medical provider to easily complete their section online once they get the required instructions from you. **Remember,** it is your responsibility to give these instructions to the medical provider to complete – they are **_not_** automatically notified by our system. If you do apply online, don’t _also_ submit that claim by mail or fax. That may delay the processing of you’re application.
In order to have a valid claim for Family Leave Insurance, you need to have paid into the program through your employment and meet minimum gross earnings requirements. Family Leave Insurance is available to most New Jersey workers.
If your employer is covered for Family Leave Insurance, they are required to set up payroll contributions for you. If you believe you are covered under the program but payroll contributions have not been made, you are still encouraged to apply as it may have been an error.  If you became unemployed recently and have a need for Family Leave Insurance, you still may be eligible for benefits and we encourage you to apply. In that case, we will forward your application to our [Family Leave During Unemployment](https://www.nj.gov/labor/myleavebenefits/worker/resources/FLDU_2020.shtml) section.
Your employer is required to report your wages to the state after each calendar quarter. When your claim is under review, we consider the earnings reported for the 5 completed quarters prior to the week your leave began. The first 4 quarters of that time frame is called the [base year](https://www.nj.gov/labor/myleavebenefits/help/glossary/index.shtml#BaseYear).

Training Requirements
Check out our video tutorial. It'll guide you through the process with detailed step-by-step instructions. Plus you'll get helpful tips for completing your application.
### Step 3: Print Instruction Forms
After your parts are complete, you'll be prompted to print instructions with a unique Online Form ID number. Give them to your family member's healthcare provider, if applicable, so they can complete their part online.

Training Deadlines
If planning ahead, you may start your online application up to 60 days in advance. To avoid deletion of your draft application: (1) within 14 days of starting the **application**, provide all information and confirm your claim; then (2) within 14 days after the start of your **leave**, certify and file your claim. If applying after your leave begins, you have 30 days from your first day of leave to file your application.
Non-Continuous (intermittent) Leave: If you are claiming benefits on an intermittent schedule, whether it be a week, a month, or a day at a time, you may receive up to 56 individual days (8 weeks) of Family Leave benefits in a 12-month period. If you take your leave in a non-continuous manner, let us know those dates _after_ taking each segment. If you are approved for Family Leave Insurance benefits but do not initially claim your maximum duration of leave when filing, we will mail you a [Continued Claim Certification (FL3)](https://myleavebenefits.nj.gov/labor/myleavebenefits/worker/resources/formlookup.shtml#FL3), which includes a schedule that you must fill out and sign – showing the days you _did not work_ during the period. You will need to submit an updated schedule after each period of leave is completed.
You must [give your employer 30 days’ notice](http://myleavebenefits.nj.gov/labor/myleavebenefits/help/faq/fli.shtml#30DaysNotice) if taking your family leave bonding in one continuous period, and 15 days' notice if taking your leave in a non-continuous manner. If you plan to care for a family member and take your leave all at once, you must [give your employer reasonable notice](http://myleavebenefits.nj.gov/labor/myleavebenefits/help/faq/fli.shtml#30DaysNotice), unless there are unforeseen or emergency circumstances and 15 days' notice for separate periods of leave.

Coverage Election
Family Leave Insurance benefits do not need to be claimed all at once. You can claim Family Leave Insurance benefits in one consecutive 12-week period, or on a day-by-day basis to suit your needs. However, the manner in which you choose to claim your leave will determine the duration of leave that you are entitled to.
New parents do not need to claim their benefits all at once. You can claim Family Leave Insurance to bond in one consecutive 12-week period, or on a day-by-day basis to suit your needs. However, the manner in which you choose to claim your leave will determine the duration of leave that you are entitled to.

Posting Requirements
You must [give your employer 30 days’ notice](http://myleavebenefits.nj.gov/labor/myleavebenefits/help/faq/fli.shtml#30DaysNotice) if taking your family leave bonding in one continuous period, and 15 days' notice if taking your leave in a non-continuous manner.

If you do not give your employer adequate notice, your benefit entitlement may be reduced by 14 days. We encourage you to **_keep your employer informed_**. Having an open discussion with your employer about your need for leave will allow them to prepare for your absence and make adjustments to work schedules if necessary. Your employer may also be able to provide insight on job protection and if you qualify for it through the federal [Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fmla) or the [New Jersey Family Leave Act (NJFLA)](https://www.nj.gov/oag/dcr/downloads/fact-FLA.pdf).
Once a payment is posted, funds should be available on your debit card within three business days of the payment date. No federal income tax is withheld from your benefits unless you request a 10 percent deduction when you apply.
