Covered Employees
From equines and energy, to coal and cars, the Bluegrass State works hard. And in large part, unions have worked hard on behalf of employees to protect their interests. As most Kentuckians know, the relationship between labor and management can often be a contentious one, to put it mildly, and requires cooperation from all sides to keep the relationship cordial. Over the past few years, many states have been passing legislation to alter the way employees, employers, and unions work together. Chief among them are so-called "right to work" laws, which allow employees in unionized workforces to refuse monthly payments.
Nearly 30 states have ["right-to-work" laws](https://www.findlaw.com/state/employment-laws/details-on-state-right-to-work-laws.html) either in their state constitution or statutory code, with many in these laws being passed in the past few years. Generally, these statutes prohibit employers from requiring union membership, or the payment of union dues, as a prerequisite to employees in getting and keeping a job.
| **Policy on Union Membership, Organization, etc.** | Kentucky Revised Statutes to the contrary, no employee shall be required, as a condition of employment or continuation of employment, to: 1. Become or remain a member of a labor organization _\[ **Note:** this is already enforced under federal labor law\]_; 2. Pay any dues, fees, assessments, or other similar charges of any kind or amount to a labor organization; or 3. Pay to any charity or other third party, in lieu of these payments, any amount equivalent to or pro rata portion of dues, fees, assessments, or other charges required of a labor organization. |
