Arkansas Overtime & Hours

Overview
NOTE: Arkansas voters passed a minimum wage increase in November 2018. To learn more, please read the [**Minimum Wage Facts**.](https://labor.arkansas.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/20FactArkansasMinimumWage.pdf) To read the Initiated Act, **[click here.](https://labor.arkansas.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2018-Initiated-Act-Issue-5.pdf)**
Effective January 1, 2021, the minimum wage in Arkansas is $11.00 per hour. The Arkansas Minimum Wage Act covers employers with 4 or more employees. Employers covered by the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) are also covered by the Arkansas law if they have 4 or more employees. An employer covered by both laws must pay the highest minimum wage. In most cases, an employer has to pay overtime (one and one-half times the regular rate of pay) to non-exempt employees for all hours actually worked in excess of 40 hours in a workweek. This means that you may work more than 8 hours in a day or work more than a regularly scheduled shift, and still not exceed 40 hours of actual work in a workweek. If your employer pays you for hours not actually worked, such as for a holiday or a sick day, then those hours do not count as hours actually worked for the purpose of state and federal overtime law.

Tipped employees must be paid at least $2.63 per hour. The tips they earn must be enough to bring them up to the applicable minimum wage per hour. If the tips do not bring them up to minimum wage, the employer must add enough to their pay to do so. It is the employer’s responsibility to keep accurate tip records.
In most instances, overtime must be paid for hours worked beyond forty in a work week. However, certain employees may be exempt from overtime. [**Click here to review some common exemptions**](https://www.dol.gov/whd/overtime/fs17a_overview.pdf).
