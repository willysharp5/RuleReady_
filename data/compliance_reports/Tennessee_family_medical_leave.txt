Tennessee Paid Family / Medical Leave (PFML)

Overview
The State of Tennessee Attendance and Leave Manual is a collection of policies established by the Tennessee Department of Human Resources (DOHR). Pursuant to Tennessee Law, the DOHR Commissioner “shall direct and supervise all administrative and technical human resources activities of state service.” See [Tenn. Code Ann. § 8-30-104](https://advance.lexis.com/documentpage/?pdmfid=1000516&crid=a3c41160-14c1-4b23-808a-fb6f59a3edd6&nodeid=AAIABDAABAAE&nodepath=%2FROOT%2FAAI%2FAAIABD%2FAAIABDAAB%2FAAIABDAABAAE&level=4&haschildren=&populated=false&title=8-30-104.+Authority+of+commissioner+%E2%80%94+Supervisory+personnel+%E2%80%94+Designees.&config=025054JABlOTJjNmIyNi0wYjI0LTRjZGEtYWE5ZC0zNGFhOWNhMjFlNDgKAFBvZENhdGFsb2cDFQ14bX2GfyBTaI9WcPX5&pddocfullpath=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fstatutes-legislation%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A4X8K-TGT0-R03K-X4M0-00008-00&ecomp=L38_kkk&prid=4ade6a8b-50e7-4fca-8949-706c3f2d8926). This includes development of personnel policies, methods, procedures, and standards for all state agencies.
The Attendance and Leave Manual provides general guidance to employees about the privileges they have as employees and the duties and responsibilities we all share. It is not intended, nor is it considered to be a contract of employment. Nothing in this handbook constitutes a waiver of the State’s sovereign immunity.

Employer Responsibilities & Deadlines
17.08 – REQUIRED BUDGETARY APPROVAL OF AGENCY OVERTIME
Several departments and agencies may require irregular work schedules for their employees because of the nature of the work. With prior approval of the department or agency's appointing authority, management at each work location has the authority to schedule arrival and departure times and specific workdays for employees depending upon local needs. The use of flex time and compressed work weeks is also subject to approval of the appointing authority. Any work schedule totaling more than thirty-seven and one-half (37.5) hours per week must have prior approval of the Commissioners of Human Resources and Finance and Administration.
An employee on an irregular work schedule must revert to a normal work week schedule when using a prolonged period of annual, sick, or compensatory leave, when placed on extended leave without pay status, and when paid through the Sick Leave Bank.
Employees shall be allowed a one (1) hour unpaid meal period. The employee should be relieved of all work responsibilities for the purpose of eating a meal. The authorized meal period must be taken during the work shift and may not be used to alter arrival or departure time by not using the meal period or any part thereof.

4.06 – RECORDING TIME

Penalties for Non-Compliance
Bereavement leave will be granted for three (3) days in the event of the death of an employee's immediate family member (defined as spouse, children (including unborn), stepchildren, siblings, parents, grandparents, grandchildren, stepparents, foster parents and parents-in-law) without charge to the employee's accumulated leave balance. The granting of bereavement leave does not increase the total number of days provided for in Chapter 5 Sick Leave, nor does it affect the use of annual leave.
For this purpose, “immediate family members” are defined as:
The use of sick leave for death of a family member is limited to three (3) days except for deaths of members of the immediate family. Leave for the death of an immediate family member is normally limited to five (5) days (three (3) days of bereavement leave plus two (2) days of sick leave). The immediate family is defined under bereavement leave. When funeral services are conducted in a locality other than where the employee resides, necessary travel time in addition to the five (5) days may be allowed. Travel documentation explaining the necessity for the extra days should be placed in the employee's leave file.
For employees receiving donated sick leave, each day is defined as seven and one-half (7.5) hours for employees on a thirty-seven and one-half (37.5) hour work week schedule and eight (8.0) hours for employees on a forty (40) hour work week schedule. Sick leave may be transferred to fellow state employees who are members of the Sick Leave Bank (SLB) who are unable to perform the duties of their jobs as a result of a personal illness, injury, accident, disability, medical condition, or quarantine and who have exhausted all sick, annual, Paid Parental Leave (if applicable), compensatory leave and leave approved through the SLB.
