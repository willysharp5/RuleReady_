Covered Employees
As a result of legislative changes during the 113 th Tennessee General Assembly session, legislators passed Public Chapter 216, which addresses leave accrual, paid parental leave, and certain employee benefits. While changes to the paid parental leave became effective on July 1, 2023, the modifications to leave accrual were set to be effective on January 1, 2024.
In summary, eligible employees will now accrue annual and sick leave yearly rather than on a monthly basis.
