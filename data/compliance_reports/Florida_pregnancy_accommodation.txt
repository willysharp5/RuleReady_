Florida Pregnancy / Disability / ADA Accommodations

Overview
On December 29, 2022, President Biden signed the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (PWFA) into law.\[ [1](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-1-p54714)\] The PWFA requires a covered entity to provide reasonable accommodations to a qualified employee's or applicant's known limitation related to, affected by, or arising out of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions, absent undue hardship on the operation of the business of the covered entity. [42 U.S.C. 2000gg-3](https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/42/2000gg-3) requires the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC or Commission) to promulgate regulations to implement the PWFA.
The PWFA requires employers to provide reasonable accommodations to qualified workers affected by pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions so they can remain healthy and in their jobs. The PWFA received broad bipartisan support in both chambers of Congress and from a wide variety of organizations representing industries, business associations, individual businesses, numerous civil rights and women's rights organizations, unions, and faith-based organizations.\[ [2](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-2-p54714)\] The bill passed in the House by a vote of 315 to 101 and in the Senate by a vote of 73-24.\[ [3](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-3-p54714)\]

Under the FMLA, covered workers can receive up to 12 weeks of job-protected unpaid leave for, among other things, a serious health condition, the birth of a child, and bonding with a newborn within one year of birth.\[ [12](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-12-p54715)\] However, employees must work for an employer with 50 or more employees within 75 miles of their worksite and meet certain tenure requirements in order to be entitled to FMLA leave.\[ [13](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-13-p54715)\] Survey data from 2018 show that only 56 percent of employees are eligible for FMLA leave.\[ [14](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-14-p54715)\] Further, the FMLA only provides unpaid leave—it does not require reasonable accommodations that would allow workers to stay on the job and continue to be paid.

The PWFA recognizes that there are gaps in the Federal legal protections for workers affected by pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions, even though they may have certain rights under existing civil rights laws, such as Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, [42 U.S.C. 2000e](https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/42/2000e) _et seq._

What Should Employers Do?
On December 29, 2022, President Biden signed the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (PWFA) into law.\[ [1](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-1-p54714)\] The PWFA requires a covered entity to provide reasonable accommodations to a qualified employee's or applicant's known limitation related to, affected by, or arising out of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions, absent undue hardship on the operation of the business of the covered entity.

The PWFA requires employers to provide reasonable accommodations to qualified workers affected by pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions so they can remain healthy and in their jobs. The PWFA received broad bipartisan support in both chambers of Congress and from a wide variety of organizations representing industries, business associations, individual businesses, numerous civil rights and women's rights organizations, unions, and faith-based organizations.\[ [2](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-2-p54714)\] The bill passed in the House by a vote of 315 to 101 and in the Senate by a vote of 73-24.\[ [3](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-3-p54714)\]
Under the ADA, certain workers affected by pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions may have the right to accommodations if they show that they have an ADA disability; this standard does not include pregnancy itself but instead requires the showing of a pregnancy-related disability.\[ [11](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-11-p54715)\]
Under the FMLA, covered workers can receive up to 12 weeks of job-protected unpaid leave for, among other things, a serious health condition, the birth of a child, and bonding with a newborn within one year of birth.\[ [12](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-12-p54715)\] However, employees must work for an employer with 50 or more employees within 75 miles of their worksite and meet certain tenure requirements in order to be entitled to FMLA leave.\[ [13](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-13-p54715)\] Survey data from 2018 show that only 56 percent of employees are eligible for FMLA leave.\[ [14](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-14-p54715)\] Further, the FMLA only provides unpaid leave—it does not require reasonable accommodations that would allow workers to stay on the job and continue to be paid.

Training Requirements
Paragraph (2) adopts the definition of “limitation” based on the PWFA and thus defines it to mean a physical or mental condition related to, affected by, or arising out of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions. The “physical or mental condition” that is the limitation may be a modest, minor, and/or episodic impediment or problem. The definition encompasses when a worker affected by pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions has a need or problem related to maintaining their health or the health of their pregnancy.\[ [43](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-43-p54719)\] The definition also includes when the worker is seeking health care related to the pregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical condition itself. This is consistent with the ADA which permits reasonable accommodations for obtaining medical treatment \[ [44](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-44-p54719)\] and recognizes that for pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions the proper course of care can include regular appointments and monitoring by a health care professional.\[ [45](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-45-p54719)\]
depression, hypertension, constraints on lifting). To the extent that a covered entity has reasonable concerns about whether a physical or mental condition or limitation is “related to, affected by, or arising out of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions,” the employer may request information from the employee regarding the connection, using the principles set out in section 1636.3(l) about the interactive process and supporting documentation. For the most part, the Commission anticipates that determining whether a limitation or physical or mental condition is related to, affected by, or arising out of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions will be a straightforward determination that can be accomplished through a conversation between the employer and the employee as part of the interactive process and without the need for the employee to obtain documentation or verification, such as documentation from a health care provider. Of course, even if a covered entity concludes that a limitation is not covered by the PWFA, the covered entity should consider whether the limitation constitutes a disability that is covered by the ADA.
The proposed rule explains that when determining whether an employee who needs leave as a reasonable accommodation meets the definition of “qualified,” the relevant inquiry is whether the employee would be able to perform the essential functions of the position, with or without reasonable accommodation (or, if not, if the inability to perform the essential function(s) is for a temporary period, the essential function(s) could be performed in the near future, and the inability to perform the essential function(s) can be reasonably accommodated), with the benefit of a period of intermittent leave, after a period of part-time work, or at the end of a period of leave or time off.\[ [61](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-61-p54723)\] Thus, an employee who needs some form of leave to recover from a known limitation caused, for example, by childbirth or a miscarriage, can meet the definition of “qualified” because it is reasonable to conclude that once they return from the period of leave (or during the time they are working if it is intermittent leave) they will be able to perform the essential functions of the job, with or without additional reasonable accommodations or will be qualified under the second part of the PWFA definition that is described in the next subsection. Of course, if an employer can demonstrate that leave would pose an undue hardship, for example, due to the length, frequency, or unpredictable nature of the time off that was requested, it may lawfully deny the request.\[ [62](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-62-p54723)\]

Training Deadlines
Under the FMLA, covered workers can receive up to 12 weeks of job-protected unpaid leave for, among other things, a serious health condition, the birth of a child, and bonding with a newborn within one year of birth.\[ [12](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-12-p54715)\] However, employees must work for an employer with 50 or more employees within 75 miles of their worksite and meet certain tenure requirements in order to be entitled to FMLA leave.\[ [13](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-13-p54715)\] Survey data from 2018 show that only 56 percent of employees are eligible for FMLA leave.\[ [14](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-14-p54715)\] Further, the FMLA only provides unpaid leave—it does not require reasonable accommodations that would allow workers to stay on the job and continue to be paid.
The reasonable accommodations provided by the PWFA for workers experiencing pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions are critical to the economic security of women workers and their families. Women are the primary, sole, or co-breadwinners in nearly 64 percent of families, earning at least half of their total household income.\[ [22](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-22-p54716)\] As of 2021, over 66 percent of women in the United States who gave birth in the prior year were in the labor force,\[ [23](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-23-p54716)\] up from about 57 percent in 2006.\[ [24](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-24-p54716)\] Moreover, an increasing number of pregnant workers are working later into their pregnancies—over 80 percent of first-time mothers who worked during their pregnancy worked into the last three months before their child's birth.\[ [25](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-25-p54716)\] The lack of accommodations for pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions means that pregnant workers can be faced with an impossible choice between their job and a necessary paycheck or their health or the health of their pregnancy.\[ [26](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-26-p54716)\] Without accommodations, pregnant workers too often may find that they must quit their jobs or face being fired, which can also mean that workers lose their employer-sponsored health insurance at a time when they especially need it. Others are forced to take leave, which can mean that the worker does not have leave to recover from childbirth later. By providing a path for accommodations for these workers, the PWFA will protect workers' ability to earn, remain in the workforce, and advance in their careers.
ii. Second, the PWFA allows an employee or applicant to be “qualified”—even if they cannot perform one or more essential functions of the job—if the inability to perform the essential function(s) is “temporary,” the worker could perform the essential function(s) “in the near future,” and the inability to perform the essential function(s) can be reasonably accommodated. The proposed rule defines the terms “temporary” (lasting for a limited time, not permanent, and may extend beyond “in the near future”) and “in the near future” (generally within forty weeks). It also discusses the meaning of the requirement that the inability to perform the essential functions(s) can be reasonably accommodated.

Qualified Trainers
On December 29, 2022, President Biden signed the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (PWFA) into law.\[ [1](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-1-p54714)\] The PWFA requires a covered entity to provide reasonable accommodations to a qualified employee's or applicant's known limitation related to, affected by, or arising out of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions, absent undue hardship on the operation of the business of the covered entity. [42 U.S.C. 2000gg-3](https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/42/2000gg-3) requires the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC or Commission) to promulgate regulations to implement the PWFA.

Special Requirements
telework; and, accommodating a worker's inability to perform one or more essential functions of a job by temporarily suspending the requirement that the employee perform that function, if the inability to perform the essential function is temporary and the worker could perform the essential function in the near future.\[ [21](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-21-p54716)\] The proposed regulation includes a non-exhaustive list of examples of possible reasonable accommodations, and the preamble and the proposed appendix include additional examples.
The reasonable accommodations provided by the PWFA for workers experiencing pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions are critical to the economic security of women workers and their families. Women are the primary, sole, or co-breadwinners in nearly 64 percent of families, earning at least half of their total household income.\[ [22](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-22-p54716)\] As of 2021, over 66 percent of women in the United States who gave birth in the prior year were in the labor force,\[ [23](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-23-p54716)\] up from about 57 percent in 2006.\[ [24](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-24-p54716)\] Moreover, an increasing number of pregnant workers are working later into their pregnancies—over 80 percent of first-time mothers who worked during their pregnancy worked into the last three months before their child's birth.\[ [25](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-25-p54716)\] The lack of accommodations for pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions means that pregnant workers can be faced with an impossible choice between their job and a necessary paycheck or their health or the health of their pregnancy.\[ [26](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-26-p54716)\] Without accommodations, pregnant workers too often may find that they must quit their jobs or face being fired, which can also mean that workers lose their employer-sponsored health insurance at a time when they especially need it. Others are forced to take leave, which can mean that the worker does not have leave to recover from childbirth later. By providing a path for accommodations for these workers, the PWFA will protect workers' ability to earn, remain in the workforce, and advance in their careers.
Importantly, the economic damage done to pregnant workers and their families due to the lack of a right to reasonable accommodation during pregnancy is especially hard-hitting for workers in low-wage jobs. These workers are the least likely to have flexibility in their jobs or savings upon which to draw if they are unemployed or on unpaid leave.\[ [27](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-27-p54716)\]

Coverage Election
### Voluntary Compliance Is Critical for the PWFA
As with other civil rights laws, voluntary compliance is critical to the success of the PWFA. If a worker quits their job because they do not receive an accommodation, it is of little use to that worker that years later they are able to establish through litigation that they should have received an accommodation. Voluntary compliance should be the norm because, while the form of reasonable accommodation will vary depending on the job and the worker's needs, the accommodations that most workers will seek likely will be no cost to low cost and may be as simple as access to water during the workday, additional bathroom breaks, or sitting or standing. Thus, participation in a good faith interactive process to quickly find an accommodation once it is requested is key, both for workers who need accommodations and for employers who need to keep workers on the job and avoid litigation costs.

with disabilities, most employers report no costs or low costs for providing these accommodations. Of the 720 employers who were able to provide cost information related to accommodations they had provided, 356 (49.4 percent) said the accommodations needed by their employees cost nothing. Another 312 (43.3 percent) experienced a one-time cost. Only 52 (7.2 percent) said the accommodation resulted in an ongoing, annual cost to the company. Of those accommodations that did have a one-time cost, the median one-time expenditure as reported by the employer was $300.\[ [33](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-33-p54717)\] While there are not data regarding the cost for accommodations specifically for pregnancy, one survey concluded that the most common accommodation needed by pregnant workers was additional breaks, especially for using the bathroom, which is a low- to no-cost accommodation.\[ [34](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-34-p54717)\] Moreover, given the nature of the accommodations required by the PWFA, virtually all will be temporary. Given these facts and the cost data from accommodations under the ADA, the actual costs an employer may face will likely be temporary and low.
Communication between workers and covered entities is the key to voluntary compliance. As set out in the proposed regulations, employees and applicants have the responsibility of asking for an accommodation. In doing so, they do not need to mention the PWFA, say any specific phrases, or use medical terms, and the request does not have to be in writing. Rather, the worker can communicate (or have someone communicate on their behalf) that the worker has a limitation that is related to pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions and the need for an adjustment or change at work. Because the statute and the regulations emphasize employee notice that is simple and straightforward, and need not be in writing, covered entities should train first-line supervisors to recognize such requests as requests for accommodations and to act on them accordingly.

Whether a physical or mental condition is related to, affected by, or arising out of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions usually will be obvious. For example, if an employee is pregnant and as a result has pain when standing for long periods of time, the employee's physical or mental condition (pain when standing for a protracted period) is related to the employee's pregnancy. An employee who is pregnant and because of the pregnancy cannot lift more than 20 pounds has a physical condition related to pregnancy. An employee who is pregnant and is seeking time off for prenatal health care appointments is attending a medical appointment related to the pregnancy. An employee who requests an accommodation to attend therapy appointments for postpartum depression has a medical condition related to pregnancy (postpartum depression) and is obtaining health care for the related medical condition. A pregnant employee who is seeking an accommodation to limit exposure to secondhand smoke to protect the health of their pregnancy has a physical or mental condition (trying to maintain the employee's health or the health of their pregnancy or increased sensitivity to secondhand smoke) related to pregnancy. A pregnant worker seeking time off in order to get an amniocentesis is attending a medical appointment related to the pregnancy. An employee who requests leave for IVF treatment for the worker to get pregnant has a related medical condition (difficulty in becoming pregnant or infertility) and is seeking health care related to it. An employee whose pregnancy is causing fatigue has a physical condition (fatigue) related to pregnancy. An employee whose pregnancy is causing back pain has a physical condition (back pain) related to pregnancy. This is not an exhaustive list of physical or mental conditions related to, affected by, or arising out of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions.
Paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) explain that a request for a reasonable accommodation under the PWFA, as with the ADA, does not need to be in writing or use any specific words or phrases. Instead, employees or applicants may request accommodations in conversation or may use another mode of communication to inform the employer.\[ [53](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-53-p54722)\] A covered entity may choose to write a memorandum or letter confirming a request or may ask the employee or applicant to fill out a form or submit the request in written form. However, the covered entity cannot ignore or close the initial request because that initial request is sufficient to place the employer on notice.\[ [54](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-54-p54722)\] Additionally, even though it is not required, an employee may choose email or other similar written means to submit a request for an accommodation to ensure clarity and create a record.

Recordkeeping Requirements
Additionally, as set out in the accompanying economic analysis of the PWFA pursuant to [Executive Order 12866](https://www.federalregister.gov/executive-order/12866), the number of workers seeking an accommodation from a given employer in a year will be small. The EEOC has calculated that in 2021, women of reproductive age (aged 16-50 years) comprised approximately 33 percent of U.S. workers. Of these, approximately 4.7 percent gave birth to at least 1 child the previous year.\[ [35](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-35-p54717)\] Not all pregnant workers require an accommodation, so the actual number of accommodations may be even lower than this number suggests. And, because the law will keep pregnant workers in the workforce, even if an employer does incur costs to provide a PWFA accommodation, the employer also may experience a reduction in turnover and money spent to hire and train a new employee.
As with other civil rights laws, voluntary compliance is critical to the success of the PWFA. If a worker quits their job because they do not receive an accommodation, it is of little use to that worker that years later they are able to establish through litigation that they should have received an accommodation. Voluntary compliance should be the norm because, while the form of reasonable accommodation will vary depending on the job and the worker's needs, the accommodations that most workers will seek likely will be no cost to low cost and may be as simple as access to water during the workday, additional bathroom breaks, or sitting or standing. Thus, participation in a good faith interactive process to quickly find an accommodation once it is requested is key, both for workers who need accommodations and for employers who need to keep workers on the job and avoid litigation costs.
providing a stool for a pregnant cashier, or allowing a pregnant worker to carry a bottle of water with them and to drink as needed), the entity should act quickly and provide the accommodation. If the entity has questions or wants to explore different reasonable accommodations, the covered entity and the employee can engage in the interactive process by, for example, having an informal conversation about the employee's needs and possible accommodations. For accommodations that require more information, the entity may need to analyze the essential functions of the job and may, when necessary and permitted under the proposed PWFA rules described below, request reasonable medical documentation. In general, these steps should be familiar to covered entities, as they are similar to the reasonable accommodation provisions, including the interactive process, of the ADA.

Penalties for Non-Compliance
Under Title VII, a worker affected by pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions may be able to obtain a workplace modification to allow them to continue to work.\[ [6](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-6-p54715)\] Typically courts have only found in favor of such claims if the worker can identify another individual similar in their ability or inability to work who received such an accommodation, or if there is some direct evidence of disparate treatment (such as a biased comment or a policy that, on its face, excludes pregnant workers).\[ [7](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-7-p54715)\] However, there may not always be similarly situated employees. For this reason, some pregnant workers have not received simple, common-sense accommodations, such as a stool for a cashier \[ [8](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-8-p54715)\] or bathroom breaks for a preschool teacher.\[ [9](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-9-p54715)\] And even when the pregnant worker can identify other workers who are similar in their ability or inability to work, some courts have still not found a Title VII violation.\[ [10](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-10-p54715)\]
In addition to pregnancy and childbirth, the PWFA covers “related medical conditions.” \[ [17](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-17-p54715)\] “Related medical conditions” is a term used in Title VII, that previously has been defined by the Commission.\[ [18](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-18-p54715)\] As discussed in detail in the section-by-section analysis of part 1636.3(b), the proposed rule explains that the existing definition will be used for the PWFA, as it is appropriate for the text of the statute. This definition reflects the government's longstanding and consistent interpretation of the phrase and, based on canons of statutory interpretation, is the legal definition Congress intended by choosing to use the same language in the same type of statute. Further, as explained in the proposed rule, the PWFA covers limitations stemming from medical conditions that are episodic in nature and related to pregnancy or childbirth. The PWFA also covers existing conditions that are exacerbated by, and therefore related to, pregnancy or childbirth, such as high blood pressure, anxiety, or carpal tunnel syndrome. While some workers may be able to address any issues that arise related to these conditions without a reasonable accommodation, indeed without even mentioning the issue at the workplace, others may need reasonable accommodations that are covered under the PWFA.
Like the ADA, the PWFA does not require a covered entity to provide a reasonable accommodation that would cause undue hardship.\[ [39](http://www.federalregister.gov/www.federalregister.gov#footnote-39-p54717)\] A covered entity may therefore lawfully deny any requested accommodation that would impose significant difficulty or expense on its operations, as defined under the ADA.
ii. Second, the PWFA allows an employee or applicant to be “qualified”—even if they cannot perform one or more essential functions of the job—if the inability to perform the essential function(s) is “temporary,” the worker could perform the essential function(s) “in the near future,” and the inability to perform the essential function(s) can be reasonably accommodated. The proposed rule defines the terms “temporary” (lasting for a limited time, not permanent, and may extend beyond “in the near future”) and “in the near future” (generally within forty weeks). It also discusses the meaning of the requirement that the inability to perform the essential functions(s) can be reasonably accommodated.
