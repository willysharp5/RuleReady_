The consequences for failure to provide Workers’ Compensation coverage can be very significant, even without a work-related injury. Specifically, the law provides that failing to insure is a disorderly persons offense and, if determined to be willful, a crime of the fourth degree. Moreover, penalties for such failure can be assessed up to $5,000 for the first ten days and up to $5,000 for each additional ten-day period of failure to insure thereafter. In the case of a corporation, liability for failure to insure can extend to the corporate officers individually. Penalties assessed for failure to insure are not dischargeable in bankruptcy.
Within 26 weeks after the worker has reached maximum medical improvement or has returned to work, a second report, called a _Subsequent Report of Injury_, must be electronically filed with the State.
