Maryland Workers’ Compensation Requirements

Overview
In Maryland, the State's role in workers' compensation began in 1902 when the Employer and Employee Cooperative Fund was established under the State Insurance Commissioner by the General Assembly ( [Chapter 139, Acts of 1902](https://msa.maryland.gov/megafile/msa/speccol/sc2900/sc2908/000001/000476/html/am476--218.html)). In April 1904, the Court of Common Pleas of Baltimore City declared the Fund to be unconstitutional in _Franklin v. The United Railways and Electric Company of Baltimore_. By May 1904, the accounts of the Fund were closed by the State Insurance Commissioner. Thereafter, the State Workers' Compensation Commission organized as the State Industrial Accident Commission in 1914 ( [Chapter 800, Acts of 1914](https://msa.maryland.gov/megafile/msa/speccol/sc2900/sc2908/000001/000533/html/am533--1429.html)). It was renamed the Workmen's Compensation Commission in 1957 ( [Chapter 584, Acts of 1957](https://msa.maryland.gov/megafile/msa/speccol/sc2900/sc2908/000001/000640/html/am640--969.html)) and, as of January 1, 1986, the Workers' Compensation Commission. By enactment of the new Labor and Employment Article of the _Annotated Code of Maryland,_ the Commission became the State Workers' Compensation Commission in 1991 ( [Chapter 8, Acts of 1991](https://msa.maryland.gov/megafile/msa/speccol/sc2900/sc2908/000001/000806/html/am806--248.html)).
The State Workers' Compensation Commission administers the Maryland Workers' Compensation Act, and adjudicates claims for compensation arising under that law (Code Labor & Employment Article, secs. 9-101 through 9-1201). Reports of accidents are received and processed by the Commission which conducts hearings of contested workers' compensation cases throughout the State. Claimants requiring rehabilitation are referred by the Commission to appropriate rehabilitation service providers.

Employers who fail to provide workers' compensation insurance coverage are assessed penalties by the Commission. For employers who wish to be self-insured in the State, the Commission is responsible for approving them, and monitoring their activities and financial solvency.

Training Deadlines
In accordance with State law, all of the Commission's expenditures, as well as certain programs within the [Maryland Department of Labor](https://msa.maryland.gov/msa/mdmanual/20dllr/html/dllr.html), are funded by assessments billed to insurance companies that issue workers' compensation insurance policies, and to companies that self-insure for workers' compensation coverage.
The Advisory Committee on the Registration of Rehabilitation Practitioners was formed within the State Workers' Compensation Commission in 1997 by the General Assembly ( [Chapter 625, Acts of 1997](https://msa.maryland.gov/megafile/msa/speccol/sc2900/sc2908/000001/000795/html/am795--3494.html)).
The Committee reviews the methodology applied to the regulation of physician fees. It recommends to the Commission a method to both develop and regularly update a multiplier to be used with Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes. The Committee also is charged with recommending the best way to annually publish, distribute, and update the _Official Maryland Workers' Compensation Medical Fee Guide_ (COMAR 14.09.03).
