Training Deadlines
Overtime is calculated based on the “workweek” which is a regularly occurring period of seven days. It could begin on any day or hour your employer chooses as long as it remains the same each week. The answer depends on the number of hours you worked during the workweek. If it’s more than 40 hours in the workweek, you should get overtime pay.
For most adult workers, there are no limits on daily work hours. Theoretically, employers may schedule employees to work seven days a week, 24 hours per day, so long as minimum wage and overtime laws are observed.
No. The required overtime pay is 1.5 times the hourly rate for hours worked in excess of 40 in a workweek. Overtime is calculated based on hours actually worked, and in this scenario you worked only 35 hours during the workweek. Unless a policy, contract or collective bargaining agreement states otherwise, you do not get overtime pay if you used sick leave, vacation time, holidays, or other paid time and did not actually work.

Yes. Examples are expense reimbursements, premium pay for Saturday, Sunday, or holiday work, discretionary bonuses, and gifts for special occasions.
EXAMPLE: If an employee worked 16 hours at $18.00 per hour and 30 hours at $20.00 per hour the total straight time amount earned is $888.00. That amount is divided by total hours-worked (46), and the weighted average hourly rate is $19.30. Since the employer has already paid the straight time rates for all hours worked, only an additional .5 times the average hourly rate is due for the overtime hours (.5 x $19.30 x 6 hours = $57.90).

The answer depends on the number of hours you worked during the workweek. If it’s more than 40 hours in the workweek, you should get overtime pay.
Can my employer offer me "comp" time off instead of paying overtime?Only government agencies are permitted to offer compensatory time in lieu of overtime. If you are a private sector employee, you must received overtime pay when you work over 40 hours in a workweek. (If you work 45 hours during one workweek, your employer could choose to schedule you for 35 hours during the following week, but you would still need to receive pay for the five hours of overtime during the first workweek.)If I work unauthorized overtime, does my employer have to pay it?
