Alaska Minimum Wage

Overview
Projects bid before July 1, 2025, do not require adjustments for Ballot Measure 1. The Little Davis Bacon Act mandates that contractors pay prevailing wages and fringe benefits listed in Pam 600 at the time of bidding. Moving forward, paid sick leave will be included in benefit calculations in all future editions of Pam 600.
## Contact Wage & Hour

Covered Employers
Wage and Hour is now providing interactive online webinars covering basic wage and hour laws for employers, contractors and employees.
Wage and Hour provides sole enforcement of several laws dealing with the payment of wages to workers (wage claims, prevailing wage, minimum wage and overtime). The agency acts on behalf of workers to collect unpaid or underpaid monies from employers through a variety of administrative, quasi-judicial and judicial procedures. The Prevailing Wage program ensures that all contractors working on public construction projects pay the same costs for labor, thereby preventing an unfair competitive advantage based on the use of cheap imported labor. The Construction Contractor Licensing program protects the public from unlicensed, unbonded contractors, while protecting properly licensed contractors from unscrupulous and unfair competition. The agency also oversees the enforcement of child labor laws to ensure that minor workers are not exploited; enforces the Alaska Family Leave Act as it applies to public employees.

Covered Employees
This change also affects salaried employees who are exempt from overtime requirements under Alaska Statute 23.10.055(b).
The minimum salary for these workers will increase from $952.80/week to $1,040.00/week.
