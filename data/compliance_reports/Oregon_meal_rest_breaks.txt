Oregon Meal & Rest Breaks

Overview
In 2023, the Oregon Legislature passed [HB 2697](https://olis.oregonlegislature.gov/liz/2023R1/Measures/Overview/HB2697), which made significant changes to Oregon’s hospital staffing law. Hospitals have always been required to provide their employees with rest breaks and meal periods, but ORS 653.261 limited BOLI’s jurisdiction when the rest and meal periods for certain hospital staff were subject to provisions of a collective bargaining agreement. HB 2697 updated ORS 653.261 and created ORS 653.258, which expressly allows BOLI to enforce rules regarding meal periods and rest periods for almost all hospital staff. [ORS 653.258](https://www.oregonlegislature.gov/bills_laws/ors/ors653.html#:~:text=c.115%20%C2%A76%5d-%2c653.258%2c-Enforcement%20of%20rules) became operative on June 1, 2025.
**Option 3: Within two years of the missed period,** these employees may file a civil action if they were not paid for the missed period. BOLI maintains a [list of attorneys](https://www.oregon.gov/boli/about/pages/contact-us.aspx#%3a~%3atext=3844%20%28option%205%29.-%2cAttorney%20List%2c-You%20can%20find) that may be willing to advise Complainants about their rights.

Covered Employers
Your employer can give you longer breaks. These are the minimum requirements.

Employees are required to be relieved of all duties during the meal period. Under exceptional circumstances, however, the law allows an employee to perform duties during a meal period. When that happens, the employer must pay the employee for the whole meal period.

**Option 1: Within 60 days of the missed rest and/or meal period,** these employees [may file a complaint with Oregon Health Authority (OHA)](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/OregonHospitalStaffingMealandRestBreakComplaint) under ORS 441.790. OHA’s Hospital Staffing Team reviews these complaints; notifies the hospital, staffing committees, and exclusive representatives; and forwards the complaints to our agency for enforcement. For repeated missed rest and/or meal periods, a new claim must be filed with OHA within 60 days of the missed rest and meal period. BOLI will notify the hospital of the allegations and conduct an investigation. If BOLI finds violations, the hospital will be required to pay to the Complainant a statutory penalty of $200 for every missed meal period or missed rest period.
**Option 2: Within two years of the missed rest and/or meal period,** these employees may file a complaint directly with BOLI under ORS 653.261. BOLI will notify the hospital of the allegations and will determine appropriate next steps. If BOLI finds violations, the Complainant may receive lost wages for missed meal periods and penalty wages. In addition, BOLI may assess civil penalties, which are not payable to the Complainant. Note: Under ORS 653.261(3), in some situations BOLI’s meal and rest break rules do not apply to nurses who provide acute care in hospital settings.

Special Requirements
​Meal periods of at least 30 minutes must be provided to non-exempt employees who work 6 or more hours in one work period. No meal period is required if the work period is less than 6 hours. Additional meal periods are required to be provided to employees who work 14 hours or more in a shift.
Employees are required to be relieved of all duties during the meal period. Under exceptional circumstances, however, the law allows an employee to perform duties during a meal period. When that happens, the employer must pay the employee for the whole meal period.
**Yes**; there are four exceptions to the requirement that an employee be provided with a 30-minute meal period in which the employee is relieved of all duties. They are as follows:

Coverage Election
Generally, no. If it is possible for you to provide the 30-minute meal period, you must do so and require the employee to take the meal break. If, however, one of the exceptions to the requirement to provide a meal period applies, you must pay the employee for working through the meal period, and you may then choose to shorten the employee’s work shift.​

Posting Requirements
3. Providing a 30-minute, unpaid meal period where the employee is relieved of all duties would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the employer’s business. When an employer can demonstrate that providing an employee a meal period would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business and does not provide the full 30-minute meal period, employees must still be provided with adequate time to consume a meal, rest and use the restroom, and must be paid for this time, in addition to being provided all rest periods required by law for the number of hours worked in any given shift. In addition, the employer must give notice to each employee affected by the undue hardship provision on a form prescribed by BOLI and maintain a copy of the notice for the duration of the employee’s employment and for at least six months after the termination date of the employee. See the
[Notice to Employees Regarding Meal and Rest Periods](https://www.oregon.gov/boli/workers/Documents/WH-161.pdf) ​, also available in
- The employer conspicuously posts a notice provided by BOLI regarding rest and meal periods.

Recordkeeping Requirements

Penalties for Non-Compliance
ORS 653.258 applies to registered nurses who provide direct care, professional staff, technical staff, and service staff employees as defined under ORS 441.760, unless that individual is covered by a collective bargaining agreement that includes a monetary remedy for missed meal and rest periods.
If any of these employees miss a rest or meal period, they have three options, each option provides a different timeline and a different potential penalty:
