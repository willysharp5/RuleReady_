Missouri Day-of-Rest / Predetermined Break Laws

Overview
An employer may reduce an employee’s wages, providing the employee is given a 30-day advance written notice of a reduction in wages. This notice requirement does not apply if an employee is asked to work fewer hours or changes to a different position with different duties. Any company or corporation violating this requirement shall pay each affected person $50, which can be recovered through court action.
- Even if an employee expected to be paid at a rate higher than the minimum wage rate, DLS can only determine back wages due to the employee based on the difference between the wages actually received and the statutorily [required minimum wage rate](https://labor.mo.gov/dls/minimum-wage).

An employer may deduct funds from an employee’s wages for cash register shortages, damage to equipment, or for similar reasons. Deductions can be made from an employee’s wages as long as the deductions do not take the employee’s wages below the required minimum hourly wage rate.
The Division of Labor Standards (DLS) investigates all wage complaints received. However, the division does not have the legal authority to **require** employers to pay employees the wages owed.

Training Deadlines
Employers are required to pay a discharged employee all wages due at the time of dismissal. If not paid at that time, the employee should contact his or her former employer by certified mail return receipt requested, requesting wages that are due. The employer has seven days to respond to the written request. If the employer does not pay the wages due within the seven days, it will be liable for additional wages to the employee until he or she is finally paid for up to sixty days.

Employers are not required to provide vacation pay, holiday pay, or severance pay — these are benefits given at an employer’s discretion. The exception would be instances where an employer has entered into a contract where certain benefits are established by agreement.
The entertainment industry, however, DOES require breaks and rest periods for youth workers. A youth cannot work more than five and one-half hours without a meal break. Additionally, a 15-minute rest period (which counts as work time) is required after each two hours of continuous work for youth in the entertainment industry.

Reciprocity/Extraterritorial Coverage
Employers must pay at least one and one-half times the employee’s regular rate of pay once overtime pay is in effect. Overtime pay begins once an employee works more than 40 hours in a work week rather than more than 8 hours in a work day. State and federal law does not allow employees to voluntarily waive their rights to overtime pay and accept straight time instead. Any employer that asks an employee to do so violates the law and employees should​ [file a wage complaint.](https://labor.mo.gov/dls/minimum-wage/file-complaint)
If an employee missed work due to their own illness, the employee may qualify for job protections under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which is a federal law administered by the U.S. Department of Labor. Under state law, no such protections exist.

Recordkeeping Requirements
DLS encourages workers who feel they have not been properly compensated to [file a wage complaint](https://labor.mo.gov/dls/minimum-wage/file-complaint). It is the employees’ right to take legal action and seek relief through the courts.
If the amount due in back wages is less than $5,000, workers may file their claim in Small Claims Court, where costs are less and it is easier to proceed without hiring private legal counsel. Individuals attempting to recover amounts above $5,000 should pursue a private right of action in circuit court.
