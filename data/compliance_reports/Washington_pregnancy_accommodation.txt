Covered Employers
The Department of Justice (DOJ) provides reasonable accommodation to DOJ employees and job applicants for employment with the Department. A reasonable accommodation is a change in the work environment or how things are usually done that enables a qualified individual with a disability to apply for a job, perform the essential functions of a job, fully access the work environment and/or to enjoy equal access to the benefits and privileges of employment. Federal law requires that employers provide reasonable accommodation to qualified individuals with a disability, unless to do so would pose an undue hardship. A qualified individual with a disability is a person who meets legitimate skill, experience, education, or other requirements of an employment position that they hold or seek, and who can perform the essential job functions with or without a reasonable accommodation.
The [Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (PWFA)](https://www.congress.gov/117/bills/hr2617/BILLS-117hr2617enr.pdf#page=1626) became effective on June 27, 2023. PWFA is a new law that requires covered employers, such as the Department, to provide reasonable accommodation to a worker’s known limitations due to pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions, unless the accommodation will cause the employer an undue hardship. Reasonable accommodation is a modification or adjustment to a job or the work environment to assist a qualified employee or a job applicant during the hiring process.

Executive Order 13164 directs all federal agencies to establish procedures to facilitate the provision of reasonable accommodations for employees and job applicants with disabilities. Pursuant to this Executive Order and our continuing obligations under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Department has established the following policy and instruction to provide reasonable accommodation.
Federal agencies are required to provide personal assistant services (PAS) during working hours to qualified persons with disabilities, who need assistance with performing activities of daily living that an individual would typically perform if he or she did not have a disability, and that is not otherwise required as an accommodation. These services include, for example, assistance with removing and putting on clothing, eating, and using the restroom. Individuals should use the DOJ reasonable accommodation process to request PAS.
