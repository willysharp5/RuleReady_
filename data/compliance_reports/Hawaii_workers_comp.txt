Hawaii Workers’ Compensation Requirements

Overview
The purpose of the WC law is to provide wage loss compensation and medical care to those employees who suffer work-related injuries.
TDI benefits partially replace wages lost when an employee is unable to work because of an off-the-job sickness or injury, if the employee meets the qualifying conditions of the law.

Covered Employers
The PHC law requires that employers provide employees adequate medical coverage for non-work related illness or injury, if employees meet the qualifying conditions of the law.
## The Disability Compensation Division (DCD) administers the Workers’ Compensation (WC) law, the Temporary Disability Insurance (TDI) law, and the Prepaid Health Care (PHC) law. Employers with one or more employees, whether working full-time or part-time, are directly affected. The information provided here is intended to assist employers, employees and insurance carriers to acquire a general understanding of the WC, TDI and PHC [laws](https://labor.hawaii.gov/dcd/find-a-law/%20target=). For comprehensive details, please refer to the laws, Chapter 386 (WC), Chapter 392 (TDI) and Chapter 393 (PHC) of the Hawaii Revised Statutes.
