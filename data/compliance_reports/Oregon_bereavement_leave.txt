What Should Employers Do?
- Sick child leave for the employee to care for their child because of an injury, illness, or condition that requires home care. Sick child leave includes both serious or non-serious health conditions, in addition to family leave for a child's serious health condition under Paid Leave Oregon. Sick child leave is also available for school and childcare closures in conjunction with public health emergencies

Additionally, Paid Leave Oregon doesn’t cover bereavement, sick child leave (when the child does not have a serious health condition) or military family leave and it does not cover leave for less than a full day, so read on to make sure you understand your rights under OFLA.
- From July 1, 2024 through December 31, 2024, OFLA will also provide up to two additional weeks of leave to facilitate the legal processes required for placement of a foster child or adoption. (Paid Leave will incorporate this leave beginning 2025.)
