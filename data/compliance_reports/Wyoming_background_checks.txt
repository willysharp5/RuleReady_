Wyoming Background Check / Ban-the-Box

Overview
Accurate and complete criminal history records are not only important to the criminal justice professions, but have become increasingly important for purposes outside the criminal justice community. Employers, volunteer programs, and professional licensing are relying extensively on accurate criminal records. The importance of accurate reporting is further highlighted in the area of voter registration. Inaccurate reporting can deny citizens of this basic right.
Criminal history information for adult offenders is maintained forever, even when the charges were dismissed or if there was a declination of prosecution. The offender may file for an expungement with the court of jurisdiction if there is a state statute allowing for expungement. If an expungement is granted, the criminal history information will still be available for criminal justice purposes.
