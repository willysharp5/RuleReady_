Oregon Prevailing Wage Laws (public contracts)

Overview
The prevailing wage rate (PWR) is the minimum hourly wage rate, including all fringe benefits, that must be paid for covered work duties performed on public works projects subject to PWR laws. BOLI classifies these typical duties to a “trade” or “occupation” (ex. Plumber, Carpenter, Roofer, etc.) and each job classification has its own prevailing wage rate.
How do I know if the project I am working on is subject to prevailing wage rate laws?

Covered Employers
Your employer should be able to inform you about whether or not the work you are performing is subject to PWR laws. Additionally, the law requires employers to post the prevailing wage rates in a conspicuous place on the project and submit certified payroll for all work on covered projects to the contracting public agency.
Your employer is required to post the applicable prevailing wage rates on the project site where you can readily access the information. ALL contractors and subcontractors are required to comply with this law.

Covered Employees
The prevailing wage for each classification includes an hourly Base Rate and an hourly Fringe Rate, and it is the combination of these two amounts that must be paid to the worker.
If you perform more than one classification of work, than you must be paid at least the applicable prevailing wage rate for the time spent working in each classification. While it is the employer’s responsibility to track separately the hours spent by each employee doing each classification, it is a good idea for all employees to keep their own record of hours worked.
**both** the hourly Base and Fringe Rates. An employer may 1) pay the entire Fringe Rate in wages, 2) take a full credit for the Fringe Rate for contributions to employee benefit programs (e.g., health insurance, pension/retirement, paid time off, apprenticeship/training), or 3) take a partial credit for the Fringe Rate for contributions to employee benefit programs and pay the remaining amount as wages.

Training Requirements
**both** the hourly Base and Fringe Rates. An employer may 1) pay the entire Fringe Rate in wages, 2) take a full credit for the Fringe Rate for contributions to employee benefit programs (e.g., health insurance, pension/retirement, paid time off, apprenticeship/training), or 3) take a partial credit for the Fringe Rate for contributions to employee benefit programs and pay the remaining amount as wages.
Examples of fringe benefit programs include health and welfare plans, vacation plan, some pension plans, and apprenticeship training. Employers may claim a credit against the hourly Fringe Rate for these bona fide fringe benefits they provide to employees. For more detailed information, visit
Safety training, drug testing, state industry council contributions, trade promotion funds, equipment costs, travel pay, per diem payments, workers’ compensation insurance do not qualify as fringe benefits.

Training Deadlines
However, if an employer establishes and maintains a “four-ten” schedule (ten hours on four consecutive days, either Monday through Thursday or Tuesday through Friday) overtime may not be due until after 10 hours per day. If an established four-ten schedule is not maintained, overtime will be owed for all hours worked over 8 per day that week. The “four-ten” schedule applies to ALL work (both prevailing and private) performed for an employer.
Does my employer have to pay me overtime on weekends and holidays?
Yes, on public works projects, workers must be paid overtime for all hours worked on Saturdays, Sundays, six legal holidays, and for hours worked over 40 in a week. If one of the legal holidays falls on a Saturday or Sunday, the preceding Friday or Monday becomes the recognized holiday and all hours worked on that day on a PWR project must be paid at an overtime rate.

Qualified Trainers
Your employer should be able to inform you about whether or not the work you are performing is subject to PWR laws. Additionally, the law requires employers to post the prevailing wage rates in a conspicuous place on the project and submit certified payroll for all work on covered projects to the contracting public agency.

Coverage Election
For example: If the owner, manager, and/or supervisor spends 60 percent or 24 hours of a 40 hour workweek performing administrative functions such as preparing time cards, supervising the project work, and arranging for deliveries, and the remaining 40 percent (16 hours) of the time performing the duties of an electrician, the individual must be paid the electrician’s prevailing wage rate for the number of hours spent that week performing electrician’s duties on public works projects.
There is an exemption for contractors certified as disadvantaged, minority, women, disabled veteran, or emerging small business enterprises for the first FOUR years of certification. Exempt contractors must still file written verification of certification with the CCB, and give the CCB written notice that they elect not to file a bond. Additionally, once awarded a public works contract, an exempt prime contractor must give written notification to the public agency that it elects not to file a public works bond, an exempt subcontractor must give written notification to the prime contractor that it elects not to file a public works bond.

Reciprocity/Extraterritorial Coverage
Safety training, drug testing, state industry council contributions, trade promotion funds, equipment costs, travel pay, per diem payments, workers’ compensation insurance do not qualify as fringe benefits.
For projects that are subject to both state and federal PWR laws, workers must receive the higher of the two published rates for the work performed on the project.

How do I file a complaint for work on an Oregon prevailing wage project?

Penalties for Non-Compliance
Possibly. Prevailing wage rate violations by employers are subject to wage claims initiated by employees for up to six years from the date of the violation ORS 12.080(1). The statute of limitations for overtime claims is two years ORS 12.110(3). However, claims for unpaid prevailing wages or benefits must be filed as soon as possible to ensure BOLI’s ability to enforce the law.
Yes; if a project is over $50,000 and meets the definition of a “public work” under the PWR law, even if the project is subject to regulation under the Davis-Bacon Act, it is also subject to the state PWR law. If a public agency (other than a federal agency) uses federal funds on a public works project, these funds become “funds of a public agency” as defined in the PWR law once the funds are in the custody and/or control of a public agency.
- “Regular basis” means either the schedule of contribution as provided in writing in the plan, fund, or program, or if none, the regular contribution schedule established by the contractor or subcontractor. For example, if the plan specifies that contributions to a bona fide fringe benefit fund be made by the fifteenth calendar day of each month following the month the wages were earned, then contributions to the fund must be made by that date. If the plan, fund or program does not specify a contribution date, or if the specified contribution date as written in the plan, fund or program does not meet the meaning of “not less often than quarterly” as defined below, the contractor or subcontractor must establish and maintain a contribution date by which payment to the plan, fund or program will be made on a regular bases and not less often than quarterly.
Ordinarily an employer is only required to pay a worker at the prevailing rate of wage for work performed on the “site of work” as defined by law. Nevertheless, the daily, weekend or holiday overtime requirements of ORS 279C.540 is specific to any labor employed by the state or a county, school district, municipality, municipal corporation or subdivision thereof through a contractor – not just public works. If off-site work is being done in fulfillment of a contract between a contractor and a public agency, the daily, weekend or holiday overtime requirements apply.
