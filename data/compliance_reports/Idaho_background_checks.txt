The system that is used for background checks has been upgraded. Watch training videos to learn what an agency's role is in the new system.

Training Deadlines
**Yes**. An individual has twenty-eight (28) days from the date the unconditional denial is issued to challenge the Department’s unconditional denial. If the unconditional denial is not challenged within thirty (30) days, the status remains and it becomes the final order of the Department.
If the individual challenges the Department’s unconditional denial, the Department will review the court records, documents, and other information provided by the individual. The Department will issue a decision within thirty (30) days from the receipt of the challenge.

Qualified Trainers
- Certified Family Homes
People working in the Department Programs; those who are licensed or certified by the Department; and those who have direct contact with children or vulnerable adults may need a criminal history and background check.

Special Requirements
Each program has set guidelines that are specific to their program to determine which participants are required to have a Department of Health and Welfare criminal history and background check.
**Enhanced background check fee:** $65.00 plus additional fees if applicable. These fees are generated when an applicant lists that they have lived in a state whose child protection registry checks charge an additional fee. The fee for the background check is visible on the applicant’s account once the application has been submitted.
We can accept check, cash, money order, credit/debit card (with an additional $1.00 plus a 3% processing fee), or an invoice letter from an authorized agency.

Coverage Election
The Background Check Unit provides fingerprinting through online scheduling or walk-ins at select offices.
