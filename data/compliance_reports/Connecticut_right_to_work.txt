Covered Employers
Unemployment compensation is a shared federal-state program. It is administered under state law, which prescribes the tax structure, qualifying requirements, benefit levels, and disqualification provisions. State laws must conform to federal requirements in many, but not all, major areas. If a state law does not conform, state employers are not able to claim credit against federal unemployment compensation taxes for state unemployment compensation taxes they pay.
**_Wage and Hour Laws_**. The law sets a minimum wage and defines which employers are obligated to pay this wage. It places hour and wage record requirements on employers. Employers must keep true and accurate records of their employees' hours and wages (except for executive, administrative, and professional employees) for three years at the employer's principal place of business. The law gives DOL investigatory and enforcement powers for these provisions.
**_Health Risks_**. The law requires employers to notify employees of carcinogens and toxic substances they use or produce in their manufacturing process or for experimentation, treatment, or research. It requires employers to establish enough non-smoking work areas to accommodate nonsmokers who request such areas. (The requirement applies to any enclosed business facility where 50 or more employees work.)

Covered Employees
To be eligible for unemployment compensation, an unemployed person must meet both monetary and non-monetary criteria. Unless the employee has earned wages equal to a certain multiple of his unemployment benefit (the multiples vary depending on the situation), he is not eligible to collect. And, in general, if he quit his job voluntarily or was fired for his own deliberate, employment-related misconduct, he cannot collect.
The chapters concerning employment regulation and wages establish rules concerning (1) wages, safety conditions, and employee privacy and (2) the prevailing wage for state financed or assisted construction.

Training Requirements
The Department of Labor (DOL) is headed by a commissioner appointed by the governor. The statutes describe the commissioner's powers. They establish several divisions within the department including the Employment and Training Commission, the Employment Security Division, and the Regional Workforce Development Boards.
**_Apprenticeship Council_**. The law establishes the State Apprenticeship Council to, among other things, adopt standards for apprenticeship programs, formulate policies concerning programs, and advise the labor commissioner on work-training standards for apprentices.
The workers' compensation law does not cover independent contractors (not defined in law but determined by workers' compensation commissioners on a case-by-case basis); outworkers (those to whom materials are given and who take them away for processing on premises outside the management's control); casual workers who are temporarily employed for purposes other than the employer's trade or business; members of the employer's family who live in his house if the employer's workers' compensation insurance premium excludes the family member; domestic service workers regularly employed in private homes less than 26 hours per week; corporate officers who choose to be excluded; and students enrolled in supervised, community-based, career education programs approved by the State Board of Education. Certain other employees are not covered by the state law because they are covered instead by various federal laws.

Training Deadlines
The Department of Labor (DOL) is headed by a commissioner appointed by the governor. The statutes describe the commissioner's powers. They establish several divisions within the department including the Employment and Training Commission, the Employment Security Division, and the Regional Workforce Development Boards.
Title 31 establishes a Division of Occupational Safety and Health within DOL. The division inspects and investigates public employee workplace conditions. The division also provides consultations to private and public employers so they can recognize and control workplace hazards and prevent injuries, illnesses, and fatalities.
**_Covered Injuries_**. An employee is entitled to compensation for any personal injury that “arises out of and in the course of his employment.” The meaning of this phrase has been interpreted and reinterpreted endlessly in 80 years of cases and is now deemed to cover a wide range of situations and injuries including some psychological or emotional injuries. In general, the law covers injuries that occur within the period of employment, at a place where the employee may reasonably be, and while the employee is reasonably fulfilling his employment duties or doing something incidental to his employment.

The law authorizes the labor commissioner, either on his own or when notified by a clinic or auxiliary clinic, to inaugurate site-specific or industry-wide studies or other surveillance activities in response to a health emergency, suggested disease cluster, or imminent hazard.
Partial disability benefits vary according to which body part is affected and the degree of permanent disability. Benefits are paid for a set number of weeks depending on the specific body part that is disabled. The schedule of benefits is specified in the workers' compensation law. In certain cases, workers with partial disabilities whose earning power is reduced may receive a temporary benefit tied to the wage differential between the pre- and post-injury jobs.

Coverage Election
**_Privacy Provisions_**. Title 31 contains some provisions aimed at protecting employee privacy. For example, it prohibits employers from electronically monitoring employees in lounges, restrooms, and locker rooms. It limits who can have access to the portion of a job application form containing information about the applicant's arrest record. It also restricts the situations in which an employer may order a prospective, current, or former employee to take a urinalysis drug test and protects the confidentiality of the test results.
The workers' compensation law does not cover independent contractors (not defined in law but determined by workers' compensation commissioners on a case-by-case basis); outworkers (those to whom materials are given and who take them away for processing on premises outside the management's control); casual workers who are temporarily employed for purposes other than the employer's trade or business; members of the employer's family who live in his house if the employer's workers' compensation insurance premium excludes the family member; domestic service workers regularly employed in private homes less than 26 hours per week; corporate officers who choose to be excluded; and students enrolled in supervised, community-based, career education programs approved by the State Board of Education.

Title 31 contains prevailing wage rules for state-funded or assisted and municipal construction projects. DOL's Public Contract Compliance Unit handles oversight of these provisions. The law applies to each contract for the construction, remodeling, refinishing, refurbishing, rehabilitation, alteration or repair of any public works project by the state or its agents, or by any state political subdivision. Monetary thresholds must be met before the law is applicable. The prevailing wage law applies where the total cost of all work to be performed by all contractors and subcontractors in connection with new construction of a public works project is $400,000 or more. It applies in connection with remodeling, refinishing, refurbishing, rehabilitation, alteration or repair of any public works project over $100,000. Contractors must be paid the prevailing rate, which is the minimum rate that is customary or prevailing for the same work in the same trade or occupation in the town in which the public works project is being constructed.

Workers' compensation is governed not just by statute but also by case law and administrative regulations and guidelines. The Connecticut Workers' Compensation Act was passed in 1913. It requires employers to compensate their employees who suffer work-related injuries or occupational diseases, regardless of who is at fault. In return for receiving compensation on a no-fault basis, employees are prohibited (except in very limited circumstances) from suing their employers or fellow employees for damages arising from work-related injuries or accidents. Workers have one year from the date of injury and three years from the date of first manifestation of an occupational disease to file a claim for workers' compensation.

Penalties for Non-Compliance
**_Wage and Hour Laws_**. The law sets a minimum wage and defines which employers are obligated to pay this wage. It places hour and wage record requirements on employers. Employers must keep true and accurate records of their employees' hours and wages (except for executive, administrative, and professional employees) for three years at the employer's principal place of business. The law gives DOL investigatory and enforcement powers for these provisions.
The federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) governs workplace safety in the private sector. But states may enact their own OSHA laws governing public-sector employers and employees. Connecticut's OSHA law closely mirrors the federal law; it applies equal or stricter standards. It places a duty on all covered employers to provide a safe workplace for the employees and is enforced by a system of citations and fines.
**_Employee_**. In order to receive workers' compensation benefits and injured claimant must be part of an employer-employee relationship and must be a covered employee. The law defines an employee as anyone who works under any contract of service or apprenticeship with an employer. The law explicitly includes certain people, such as volunteer firefighters and members of the General Assembly. It also allows sole proprietors and business partners to be covered voluntarily.
The workers' compensation law does not cover independent contractors (not defined in law but determined by workers' compensation commissioners on a case-by-case basis); outworkers (those to whom materials are given and who take them away for processing on premises outside the management's control); casual workers who are temporarily employed for purposes other than the employer's trade or business; members of the employer's family who live in his house if the employer's workers' compensation insurance premium excludes the family member; domestic service workers regularly employed in private homes less than 26 hours per week; corporate officers who choose to be excluded; and students enrolled in supervised, community-based, career education programs approved by the State Board of Education. Certain other employees are not covered by the state law because they are covered instead by various federal laws.
