Covered Employers
State law protects your job. Your employer can't fire you, demote you, threaten you or otherwise hassle you because of jury service.
There are no strict or prescribed dress codes. Some courts suggest dressing as you would for church, a business meeting or a social function. Dress comfortably, but avoid extremes in dress; for instance, no tuxedos or ragged jean cutoffs.
##### What is this "challenge" business? Will I have to answer a lot of private and personal questions?

Covered Employees
No. But, you must not discuss the case with anyone during the trial, not even the other jurors, and you should avoid reading about it in newspapers or listening to or watching news broadcasts about it. Don't discuss it with court personnel or any of the parties involved. When the trial is over and the judge sends you to the deliberation room, then and only then should you discuss the case freely with the other jurors in order to reach a verdict.
Not really. The presiding juror, who is elected by the jurors when the jury begins its deliberations, announces the verdict in court. Since all decisions must be unanimous, it's pretty well known how each person voted. However, a lawyer may request that a jury be polled after the verdict is announced. Each juror must then stand and announce how he or she voted. If by chance there is a change of a vote, then the jury must go back and consider the matter again. No juror has to say anything to anyone after the trial about what went on in the jury room, or why a particular decision was reached. This includes inquiries from court personnel, the opposing parties or their attorneys, or the news media. There is no prohibition against talking about it, either.

What Should Employers Do?
**If you are requesting excusal or deferral from Jury Service you must fill out your Jury Questionnaire before requesting excusal or deferral.**
Why not? The court keeps a "master list" of eligible jurors compiled from lists of voters, motor vehicle licenses, and other sources. When it has a jury term coming up, the court asks that a certain number of jurors be randomly selected for jury duty. Jurors must be at least 18 years old; U.S. citizens; North Dakota and county residents; able to read, speak and understand English reasonably well; physically and mentally able with reasonable accommodation to serve; and free from any loss of civil rights because of imprisonment for a felony.
Yes - most of the time. State law requires all qualified North Dakotans to serve as jurors. The court very reluctantly excuses persons from jury duty. A lack of any of the qualifications listed earlier will cause a person to be disqualified for jury duty. In addition, the court will consider excuses upon satisfactory showing of undue hardship, extreme inconvenience, and public necessity.
Generally this is the obligation and responsibility of the attorneys. In some civil cases the judge may permit jurors to submit questions in writing.

Training Requirements
> "Do you solemnly swear that you will consider all the evidence in this case, follow the instructions given to you, deliberate fairly and impartially and reach a fair verdict? So help you God."
At the end of every case, both civil and criminal, the judge gives the jury instructions. These instructions are intended to tell the jury what its choices are and to clarify the decisions it must make (some judges give part of the instructions at the beginning of a case).

Training Deadlines
In most instances, not any longer than 10 court days in any two year period.
It's possible but unlikely. You could be "challenged" off all the juries during your service, or you could serve on just one case that might last several days. Most likely you will serve as a juror for two or three cases during your tour of duty.
This is a matter within the discretion of the judge. However, unless you are provided with note pads and pencils by the bailiff, it will generally not be allowed.

Qualified Trainers
Yes - most of the time. State law requires all qualified North Dakotans to serve as jurors. The court very reluctantly excuses persons from jury duty. A lack of any of the qualifications listed earlier will cause a person to be disqualified for jury duty. In addition, the court will consider excuses upon satisfactory showing of undue hardship, extreme inconvenience, and public necessity.
Being challenged off a jury panel is absolutely no reflection on a prospective juror. It does not mean the lawyer or the court believes you are not qualified to sit on the case. It merely means that for this particular case a lawyer for one of the sides, or the judge, believes you may not be well suited. You could well be selected as a juror in the next case before the court.

Special Requirements
Yes. Jurors receive $50 for the first half day and $100 for serving the whole day. Jurors receive $100 for each additional day served. The mileage rate is $0.70 per mile. Coroner's inquest jurors get $10 a day.
Not really, but you will have to answer some questions. All the jurors called for a particular term are in the courtroom at the start of a trial. The clerk of court randomly selects names and the persons take their places in the jury box. When a sufficient number have been selected, they are sworn in for jury examination. This examination is called the voir dire (pronounced vwor deer) examination and is usually conducted by the lawyers in the case, although sometimes a judge will participate or conduct it.

Employer Notification Requirements
The judge or one of the lawyers begins voir dire with a short explanation of the case. While this is not proof or evidence, you should pay attention since this is the first information you'll receive about the case.
##### How is my private information utilized/protected?
Juror information is use by the court system during the summons and qualification process as well as to provide compensation. If your Social Security Number is requested --it is for the purpose of paying juror fees and mileage and is maintained by the court system’s finance department. Additionally, North Dakota court rule provides that names, physical/email addresses and phone numbers of qualified and summoned jurors (and any contents of jury qualification forms) are exempt from being open to the public. This means that a district judge would need to decide whether or not to order the release of this information. This information is requested infrequently by lawyers involved in a case in which you may serve.

Posting Requirements
Not specified in available documentation

Recordkeeping Requirements

Penalties for Non-Compliance
Next is to report to jury duty at the court or other location indicated in the summons. Failure to do so can lead to all kinds of unpleasant things like contempt of court charges, fines, and even jail terms.
In criminal cases, the state is charging a person or persons with violations of criminal law. A prosecutor, usually a state's attorney, represents the government. The person accused of the crime is the defendant, who is usually represented by a private attorney, not a public official. A civil case, on the other hand, is a dispute between the two persons or organizations concerning their respective rights. One party sues to determine these rights. This is the plaintiff. The persons being sued are the defendants. Civil suits usually involve money or property, and no criminal violations are involved.
