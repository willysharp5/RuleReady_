3. Does the change in the West Virginia state Prevailing Wage law affect the West Virginia Public bidding statute? No. The state of West Virginia, every political subdivision thereof, every administrative entity including all municipalities and all county board must solicit competitive bids for every construction project exceeding $25,000.00 in total cost with a few exceptions such as emergency work.
5. Is there a prevailing wage requirement on publicly bid construction projects with a total project value of $500,000.00 or less? There is no prevailing wage requirement on solely state funded construction projects of total value of $500,000.00 or less. (State and federal minimum wage laws still apply). However, projects that are paid for with federal money, either partially or fully, fall under the Federal Davis-Bacon Act. Therefore, on jobs with federal money whose project value is $2,000 or more, the higher of the federal prevailing wage rates or the state prevailing wage rates will apply.
8. Does the $500,000.00 threshold apply to the total cost of the project? Yes. The total project cost, or in the case of a grant to a private entity, the total grant. A project that may have two or more contracts still requires prevailing wage rates if the total cost of the project is greater than $500,000 regardless of the cost of the individual contracts.
