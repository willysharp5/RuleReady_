To be eligible for FMLA leave, an employee must have worked for their employer for at least 12 months, have worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12 months preceding the leave, and work at a location where the employer has at least 50 employees within a 75-mile radius.
Even without a statewide mandate, employers in Missouri should be aware of any local ordinances that may require paid sick leave. Some cities or counties may have enacted their own laws to address this issue. It is important to check with local government resources to determine if such ordinances exist in your area.
