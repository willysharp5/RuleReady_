Covered Employees
The [Davis-Bacon Act](https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/statutes/dbra.htm), as amended, requires that each contract over $2,000 to which the United States or the District of Columbia is a party for the construction, alteration, or repair of public buildings or public works shall contain a clause setting forth the minimum wages to be paid to various classes of laborers and mechanics employed under the contract. Under the provisions of the Act, contractors or their subcontractors are to pay workers employed directly upon the site of the work no less than the locally prevailing wages and fringe benefits paid on projects of a similar character.  The [Davis-Bacon Act](https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/statutes/dbra.htm) directs the Secretary of Labor to determine such local prevailing wage rates. These prevailing wage rate determinations apply to most VTrans federally-aided highway construction projects. The wage schedules also illustrate holiday and fringe benefits available for certain classifications.
