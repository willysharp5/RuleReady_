Covered Employees
1. **Basic Hourly Rate**: This is the hourly wage rate contractors must pay workers under prevailing wage laws. It is determined based on local wage surveys for specific job classifications.
3. **Total Hourly Rate**: This includes the basic hourly wage plus any fringe benefits (such as health insurance, retirement, or vacation pay) the worker is entitled to. Contractors can either provide these fringe benefits directly or pay the total hourly rate in cash if benefits are not provided.
If a contractor does not offer fringe benefits, they must compensate the worker by paying the total hourly rate, including the basic wage and an equivalent amount instead of benefits.

What Should Employers Do?
In North Dakota, public works generally refer to construction, repair, or maintenance projects involving public infrastructure or government-owned facilities. These include schools, highways, water treatment plants, and government buildings. When these projects are federally funded, they are subject to Davis-Bacon prevailing wage requirements.
## **Prevailing Wage Determinations: Federal (Davis-Bacon) Requirements**
- **Davis-Bacon Act (Federal Requirement)**: The U.S. Department of Labor determines the prevailing wage rates based on local wage data for public works projects receiving federal funding in North Dakota. These wage determinations are based on surveys of wages paid to various labor categories in the area where the project is located.
- **No State-Specific Requirements**: North Dakota does not have a state prevailing wage law, meaning only federally-funded projects are affected by prevailing wage requirements. This includes projects funded through federal programs such as the Department of Transportation or the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
