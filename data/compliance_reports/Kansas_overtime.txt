Recordkeeping Requirements
Kansas law provides a procedure for our Office of Employment Standards to help you collect your unpaid wages. A wage claim is made when you believe you have not been paid all of your earned wages. Once you file your wage claim, the Office of Employment Standards will review it to make sure it is complete and can be processed. If there are any issues found that would prevent your claim from processing, you will be notified of what it is and what you can do to fix it.
