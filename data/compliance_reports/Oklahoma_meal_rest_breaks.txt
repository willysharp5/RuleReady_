Oklahoma Meal & Rest Breaks

Overview
**(b) Meal breaks.**  Employees take at least a 30-minute non-paid meal break during each six-hour period on duty which is not counted as time worked.   Employees are relieved of all duties during their meal breaks and are encouraged to leave their desk or work areas during their meal breaks to take advantage of the relief from duties.  Employees record any work-related interruptions of meal breaks and advise their supervisor as they occur.  This is necessary to accurately track actual time worked.  Occasional exceptions to the requirement for employees to take a meal break may be made by the supervisor or local administrator for good cause shown, but an exception should not be part of a regular schedule.
