District of Columbia Right-to-Work Laws (where applicable)

Overview
RICHMOND — As the race for Virginia governor heats up, the role of the Commonwealth’s “right-to-work” law shows one big divide between the two candidates.
Lt. Gov. Winsome Earl-Sears has pledged to keep Virginia’s right-to-work law in place. It prohibits mandatory union membership in the workplace. Former Democratic Congresswoman Abigail Spanberger has called for reforms but not an outright repeal of the law, which allows each worker to decide whether to pay union dues and yet still retain the benefits of a union contract.

Covered Employers
A Virginia Commonwealth University poll found  49% of Virginians  approve of Youngkin’s record as governor. In the same poll, Spanberger led Earl-Sears by eight points, 49-37. Coleman noted the move by Spanberger to call for reform, rather than repeal, plays to both pro-labor and pro-business audiences.

Proponents of the laws said they give workers the freedom to choose union membership, while opponents contend they are mostly meant to weaken labor unions.

“My advice to Spanberger at this point would be not to say anything too controversial, just keep your lead,” Coleman urged. “Be kind of ‘all things to all people,’ to the extent you can be. And I think you can kind of see that with the position she took on this.”
