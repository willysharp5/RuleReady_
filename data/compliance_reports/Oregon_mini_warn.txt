# WARN Act Notifications – Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification
The HECC Office of Workforce Investments sends out public notifications regarding some impending layoffs under the authority of the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act. The WARN Act offers protection to workers, their families, and communities by requiring employers to give a 60-day notice to the affected employees and to both state and local representatives prior to a plant closing or mass layoff.
Advance notice provides employees and their families time to transition and adjust to the prospective loss of employment, time to seek alternative jobs and, if necessary, time to obtain skills training or retraining to successfully compete in the job market.

What Should Employers Do?
In general, employers must follow the requirements of the WARN Act if they have 100 or more employees, excluding employees who have worked less than six months during the last 12 months or who work an average of less than 20 hours per week. Private, for-profit employers and private, nonprofit employers are included, as are public and quasi-public entities which operate in a commercial context and are separately organized from the regular government. Federal, state, and local government entities that provide public services and tribal governments are not included under the Act.
A covered employer must give notice if an employment site (or one or more facilities or operating units within an employment site) will be shut down and the shutdown will result in an employment loss for 50 or more employees during any 30-day period.
A covered employer must give notice if there is a mass layoff, which does not result from a business closing, but will result in an employment loss at the employment site during any 30-day period for 500 or more employees, or for 50-499 employees if they make up at least 33 percent of the employer’s active workforce.
An employer must also give notice if the number of employment losses, which occur during a 30 day period, fails to meet the threshold requirement of a business closing or mass layoff but the number of employment losses of two or more groups of workers, each of which is less than the minimum number needed to trigger notice, reaches the threshold level during any 90-day period of a business closing or mass layoff. Job losses within any 90-day period will count toward WARN threshold levels unless the employer demonstrates that the employment losses during the 90-day period are the result of separate and distinct actions and causes.
