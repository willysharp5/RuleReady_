# Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (PWFA)
The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (PWFA) was recently signed into law and takes effect on June 27, 2023. The new federal law aims to protect the rights of pregnant employees by requiring employers to treat known limitations resulting from pregnancy, childbirth, and related medical conditions as conditions essentially equivalent to a disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).

What Should Employers Do?
Similar to the ADA, the PWFA requires the university to engage in the interactive process to identify reasonable accommodations. Under the PWFA, reasonable accommodations are intended to enable an employee to remain in active work status.
It is also important to note that unlike the ADA, no disability is required for reasonable accommodations under the PWFA. The PWFA requires only that there be a known limitation related to pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical condition.
