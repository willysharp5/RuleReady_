The right to trial by jury is a fundamental principle of our democracy and is guaranteed by both the United States Constitution and the Rhode Island Constitution. Trial by jury is the American democratic way of administering justice. In criminal cases, jurors decide whether the state has proven guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Many civil cases, such as suits for damages caused by an accident or contract disputes, are also decided by a jury. Thus, jurors play an important and vital part in the administration of justice.
