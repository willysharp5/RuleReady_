Missouri Pregnancy / Disability / ADA Accommodations

Overview
If a patient's pregnancy begins to interfere with their job, under federal laws they may have the right to obtain work adjustments, known as accommodations, that allow them to remain employed, without jeopardizing their health. This document briefly explains how you, the health care provider, can help your patient obtain accommodations of pregnancy-related conditions under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).
Importantly, the [Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (PWFA)](https://www.eeoc.gov/wysk/what-you-should-know-about-pregnant-workers-fairness-act), which took effect on June 27, 2023, expands the rights of workers affected by pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions to receive accommodations. The PWFA applies to some pregnancy-related situations where the ADA may not. _Thus, if your patient is seeking an accommodation due to pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions, please first consult_ [_Helping Patients Deal with Pregnancy-_ _and Childbirth– Related Limitations and Restrictions at Work Under the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act_](https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/helping-patients-deal-pregnancy-and-childbirth-related-limitations-and-restrictions), which explains how to help patients obtain these accommodations under the PWFA.

Covered Employers
If the employer asks if your patient has a “disability,” note that **a condition does not have to be permanent or severe, or result in** **a high degree of functional limitation, to be "substantially limiting."** It may qualify by, for example, making activities more difficult, uncomfortable, or time-consuming to perform compared to the way that most people perform them. Further, if symptoms come and go, what matters is how limiting they would be when present. A condition would meet the ADA’s definition of disability if it would, when left untreated, "substantially limit" one or more major life activities (e.g., lifting, standing, sitting, walking, reaching, bending, eating, sleeping, or concentrating) or major bodily functions (e.g., digestive, genitourinary, bowel, bladder, neurological, circulatory, or cardiovascular functions).
If your patient needs an accommodation to do their regular job because of a disability, the employer **must** give them one, without reducing their pay, unless doing so would involve **significant** difficulty or expense.
Your patient may ask you to provide information or a note stating that the patient is pregnant, and describing pregnancy-related impairments, restrictions or limitations. Sometimes an employer will ask for additional information. Your feedback to the employer is most likely to help your patient get an ADA accommodation if it explains, using plain language, the following:

Importantly, the [Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (PWFA)](https://www.eeoc.gov/wysk/what-you-should-know-about-pregnant-workers-fairness-act), which took effect on June 27, 2023, expands the rights of workers affected by pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions to receive accommodations. The PWFA applies to some pregnancy-related situations where the ADA may not. _Thus, if your patient is seeking an accommodation due to pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions, please first consult_ [_Helping Patients Deal with Pregnancy-_ _and Childbirth– Related Limitations and Restrictions at Work Under the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act_](https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/helping-patients-deal-pregnancy-and-childbirth-related-limitations-and-restrictions), which explains how to help patients obtain these accommodations under the PWFA.
If your patient cannot work for a period of time due to a pregnancy-related impairment and has no paid leave, the patient still may be entitled to unpaid leave as an accommodation. An employee may also qualify for unpaid leave for up to 12 weeks under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). More information about this law can be found at the [U.S. Department of Labor’s FMLA home page](http://www.dol.gov/whd/fmla). Some states and localities have passed laws that provide additional protections.
The ADA prohibits employers from engaging in discrimination and harassment based on disability, including when it is related to pregnancy, and from retaliating against employees because they have asked for or used an ADA accommodation.

What Should Employers Do?
If your patient needs an accommodation to do their regular job because of a disability, the employer **must** give them one, without reducing their pay, unless doing so would involve **significant** difficulty or expense.
The employer, perhaps in consultation with a health care professional, will use the information to determine whether a work adjustment is required under the ADA. The employer also may contact you to ask for clarification of what you have written, or to provide you with additional information to consider. For example, you may be asked whether a different work adjustment would be effective if the requested accommodation would be too difficult or costly to provide.
The ADA does not alter a health provider's ethical or legal obligations. Employers are required to keep all medical information related to an accommodation request confidential.

Special Requirements
Your patient may ask you to provide information or a note stating that the patient is pregnant, and describing pregnancy-related impairments, restrictions or limitations. Sometimes an employer will ask for additional information. Your feedback to the employer is most likely to help your patient get an ADA accommodation if it explains, using plain language, the following:
- The need for an accommodation. Explain how the patient's medical condition makes changes at work necessary. For example, if the patient needs an accommodation to perform a particular job function, you should explain how the patient's symptoms- _as they actually are, with treatment_-make performing the function more difficult. If necessary, ask the patient for a description of job duties. Also explain to the employer why the patient may need an accommodation such as a schedule change (e.g., to attend medical appointments during the workday.) _Limit your discussion to the specific problems stemming from the medical condition that may be helped by an accommodation_.
- Suggested accommodation(s). If you are aware of an accommodation that you believe would be effective, you may suggest it. Do not overstate the need for a particular accommodation in case an alternative is necessary.
