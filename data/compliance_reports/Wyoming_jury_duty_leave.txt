Training Deadlines
The Wyoming Judicial Branch strives to ensure that jurors are not called by multiple jurisdictions within a particular year. However, there may be some instances when you may be called to serve as a juror for both Federal and State courts. This is due to a number of different factors, including the fact that Wyoming is a state with a small population and the fact that the State and Federal courts have different jurisdictional limits.
If you are called for jury duty, pursuant to Wyo. St. Ann. § 1-11-103, you will be paid thirty dollars ($30) for each full or part day of actual attendance. Any juror in attendance for longer than five (5) days (excluding weekends and holidays) may, at the discretion of the court, be paid an additional twenty dollars ($20) per day.

Employer Notification Requirements
Why does my deceased family member continue to receive jury questionnaires and how do I notify the court of his/her status?
The Wyoming Judicial Branch partners with the State of Wyoming Vital Statistics office to remove deceased individuals from the jury selection process. However, this process takes place twice a year, which means that there may be a slight delay between the time that a person passes away and the time that the system is updated. If your family member has recently passed away and a summons for jury duty was received naming him or her, you may inform the court which sent the summons of your family member’s passing by submitting the information online through the jury system or by submitting the information to the court in writing.
