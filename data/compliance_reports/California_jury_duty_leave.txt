California Jury Duty Leave

Overview
Two types of trials have juries: [criminal](https://www.courts.ca.gov/3954.htm#criminal) trials and [civil](https://www.courts.ca.gov/3954.htm#civil) trials. Juvenile and family law trials do not have juries.
No. Staff of the superior courts will never ask past or prospective jurors for personal information like financial history, credit card numbers, bank account numbers, or Social Security numbers. Do not provide this type of information to anyone claiming to be associated with the courts, and contact your local jury office if you receive this type of request. If you receive a telephone call, an e-mail or other form of electronic communication from someone identifying himself or herself as a court employee and requesting your personal information, you may be the victim of a jury fraud scam. Please do not provide any information and immediately contact the fraud unit of your local police department and the jury office of your local court.

Covered Employers
Your employer must allow you time off to serve on a jury. That is the law. The California Labor Code prevents any employer from firing or harassing an employee who is summoned for jury service. School employees and students are protected as well in different parts of the law. However, you must let your employer know well in advance, as soon as you receive your summons. You should contact the court if you have a problem with your employer. Remember that you can postpone jury service to a more convenient time. Read your summons carefully or contact your local [jury office](https://www.courts.ca.gov/8078.htm) to find out how to request a [postponement](https://www.courts.ca.gov/3954.htm#postpone).

Covered Employees
### Will staff of the jury manager’s office ask me for financial or personal information?
No. Staff of the superior courts will never ask past or prospective jurors for personal information like financial history, credit card numbers, bank account numbers, or Social Security numbers. Do not provide this type of information to anyone claiming to be associated with the courts, and contact your local jury office if you receive this type of request. If you receive a telephone call, an e-mail or other form of electronic communication from someone identifying himself or herself as a court employee and requesting your personal information, you may be the victim of a jury fraud scam. Please do not provide any information and immediately contact the fraud unit of your local police department and the jury office of your local court.
Selection is random. If you have already responded to a summons or have served in the past 12 months, contact your local [jury office](https://www.courts.ca.gov/8078.htm). Explain to the staff person that you have been summoned twice in 12 months. It is important for you to contact the court to resolve the problem.

What Should Employers Do?
As a juror you participate in an important public process and fulfill a civic obligation. All persons accused of a [crime](https://www.courts.ca.gov/3954.htm#criminal) or involved in a [civil dispute](https://www.courts.ca.gov/3954.htm#civil) have a [constitutional right](https://www.courts.ca.gov/3954.htm#constitution) to have a jury decide their cases. When you serve on a jury, you make important decisions affecting other people's lives as well as your own community.
**Beginning January 1, 2020, certain individuals with a criminal history may serve on California trial juries.** However, if you have been convicted of a felony and are currently on parole, postrelease community supervision, felony probation, or mandated supervision for the conviction of a felony, you remain disqualified from jury service. Additionally, if any individual is incarcerated in any prison or jail, they are disqualified from jury service. Also, those who are currently required to register as a sex offender pursuant to Section 290 of the Penal Code based on the felony conviction are not eligible for jury service. Finally, any person who has been convicted of malfeasance in office and whose civil rights have not been restored may not serve on a jury.
### What happens to my job obligations?
Your employer must allow you time off to serve on a jury. That is the law. The California Labor Code prevents any employer from firing or harassing an employee who is summoned for jury service. School employees and students are protected as well in different parts of the law. However, you must let your employer know well in advance, as soon as you receive your summons. You should contact the court if you have a problem with your employer. Remember that you can postpone jury service to a more convenient time.

Training Requirements
You do not need to speak perfect English to serve as a juror. The court uses common, everyday language that people can understand. The work done by the courts affects all people, so it is important that all communities be a part of our justice system. No one person has to know everything. Jurors decide the outcome of a trial as a group, with each member making an important contribution. If you cannot understand English, follow the instructions on the summons or contact the [jury office](https://www.courts.ca.gov/8078.htm). If you need assistance, a friend or a family member who speaks English can call for you. However, you may still have to come in person to request a [disqualification](https://www.courts.ca.gov/3954.htm#disqualification).

Training Deadlines
Selection is random. If you have already responded to a summons or have served in the past 12 months, contact your local [jury office](https://www.courts.ca.gov/8078.htm). Explain to the staff person that you have been summoned twice in 12 months. It is important for you to contact the court to resolve the problem.
Trial length depends on how complex the issues are and how long jurors spend in [deliberations](https://www.courts.ca.gov/3954.htm#deliberations). Most trials are completed within a week. The judge knows approximately how long the trial will take and he or she will give you an idea when your group is called for [jury selection](https://www.courts.ca.gov/3954.htm#jury%20selection). Judges are aware that long trials can be difficult. Let the judge know if it would be a serious hardship for you to serve on a long trial. Please be patient during this process, because a lot of people have similar concerns about time.

After long and stressful trials, some jurors may feel disoriented. Some jurors may also need to talk to a professional about feelings that the trial may have brought up. The Judicial Council of California published a brochure to help address these issues titled _[Jury Service Stress: Relief, Support, and Self Help](https://courts.ca.gov/system/files/2024-08/Jury_Stress_Relief.pdf)_.
