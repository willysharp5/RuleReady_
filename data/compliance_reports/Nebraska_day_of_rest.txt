Covered Employers
Each office of the Nebraska Judicial Branch shall take steps to ensure employees within the system are recruited and selected based on an open and competitive basis. The necessary knowledge, skills, and abilities for the specific position shall be the principal factors considered in the selection process. Selection procedures shall be uniformly administered in making a final hiring decision. Each office is responsible for documenting all required selection activities involved in the hiring process, including the interview questions and any other screening tool. A copy of the hiring procedure shall be sent to the AOCP. Applications and all other material used in the hiring process may be disposed of 3 years after the date of application.   When a vacancy occurs, permission to fill the vacancy must be obtained from the AOCP. Job notices are normally advertised both internally and externally. Exceptions may be granted by the AOCP in the event that the nature of work and the business needs of a local office support a shift in the office’s job classifications from one type of job to another type of job, and the need for rebalancing has extended beyond a 6-month period. In those circumstances only, the local office shall submit a request to the AOCP, citing the business need and classifications affected. If approved, existing vacant positions will be reclassified, after which the Office may “post” any remaining reclassification opportunities internally amongst eligible employees within the District/County and, through a competitive selection process, assign the new job classification(s) to the most qualified candidate(s). Where the need for rebalancing will result in downward reclassification, candidates for reclassification will be identified based on performance. (See Job Reclassification.) Other exceptions will be considered based on the operational needs of the local office. Amended July 9, 2015; amended May 10, 2017; amended October 23, 2024, effective January 1, 2025.

They may complete Section 1 before this date, but only after acceptance of an offer of employment. New employees choose the documents to present from the list of acceptable verification documents. Supervisors must complete Section 2 of Form I-9 in its entirety within 3 days of the employee’s date of hire. To complete Section 2, supervisors must physically examine documents presented by the employee that establish his or her identity and employment authorization. Supervisors must not specify which documents from the “Lists of Acceptable Documents” on Form I-9 the employee must present. Employers may reject a document if it does not reasonably appear to be genuine or to relate to the person presenting it. The completed I-9 form shall be included in the employee’s personnel file and a copy of the form shall be sent to the AOCP. Amended July 16, 2003; amended October 23, 2024, effective January 1, 2025.

Following completion of their provisional period, probation officers will be issued a badge.  All probation staff are responsible for any state equipment or business related items entrusted to them and the same shall be returned to their supervisor upon termination of employment.     All employees are required to complete new employee orientation and required training for their specific position.

They may complete Section 1 before this date, but only after acceptance of an offer of employment. New employees choose the documents to present from the list of acceptable verification documents. Supervisors must complete Section 2 of Form I-9 in its entirety within 3 days of the employee’s date of hire. To complete Section 2, supervisors must physically examine documents presented by the employee that establish his or her identity and employment authorization. Supervisors must not specify which documents from the “Lists of Acceptable Documents” on Form I-9 the employee must present. Employers may reject a document if it does not reasonably appear to be genuine or to relate to the person presenting it. The completed I-9 form shall be included in the employee’s personnel file and a copy of the form shall be sent to the AOCP. Amended July 16, 2003; amended October 23, 2024, effective January 1, 2025.

Penalties for Non-Compliance
Furloughs are defined as placing an employee in a temporary non-duty, non-pay status because of the short-term lack of funds. This is an alternative to allow continuation of critical work and retention of valuable employees.   Layoffs are defined as involuntary employee separations from employment. Layoffs may be necessary for reasons such as elimination or reduction of funds, reduction in the workload, and/or reorganization.   The Nebraska Supreme Court decides when a furlough or layoff plan is necessary and directs the AOCP to develop such a plan.   Furlough and layoff plans shall provide as much notice as possible but at least a 15 workday written notice to affected employees. Amended July 9, 2015; amended October 23, 2024, effective January 1, 2025.
Full-time employees earn sick leave at the following rates:  YEARS OF CONTINUOUS EMPLOYMENT HOURS PER CALENDAR YEAR DAYS PER CALENDAR YEAR 1st through 5th year 96 hours 12 days 6th year 136 hours 17 days 7th year 144 hours 18 days 8th year 152 hours 19 days 9th year 160 hours 20 days 10th year 168 hours 21 days 11th year 176 hours 22 days 12th year 184 hours 23 days 13th year 192 hours 24 days 14th year 200 hours 25 days 15th year 208 hours 26 days 16th year 216 hours 27 days 17th year 224 hours 28 days 18th year 232 hours 29 days 19th year and thereafter 240 hours 30 days Maximum Accural 1440 hours 180 days    Permanent part-time employees shall earn sick leave in an amount proportionate to that which would have been earned under full-time employment. Temporary employees shall not be eligible for sick leave.    Sick leave is defined to mean a period during which the employee is unable to perform his or her duties because of sickness, disability, or injury not arising from the course of employment; or for medical, psychological, surgical, dental, or optical examination or treatment; or when, by reason of the employee's exposure to a contagious disease, the employee's presence would jeopardize the health of others.    Sick leave for immediate family is defined to mean a period during which the employee's presence is required to provide medically-related care for a member of the employee's immediate family because of sickness, disability, or injury; or for medical, psychological, surgical, dental, or optical examination or treatment. The immediate family shall be considered as spouse, children, and parents. At the State Court Administrator or State Probation Administrator's discretion, the definition of immediate family may be broadened to include other individuals with a like relationship to the employee as that of an immediate family member. Employees must use vacation time for care of family members when their presence is helpful, but not essential, if approved by the supervisor.    The amount of leave earned by each employee is based on the employee’s years of continuous employment. For example, during the ninth year of continuous employment, sick leave is earned at the rate of 1.67 days per month and an employee is eligible to use the earned sick leave in addition to any accumulated time based on the previous year’s service. Sick leave is earned during each pay period and credited to the employee at the end of that pay period. For example, leave earned in October is available to use on the first of November.    Leave that is used is deducted from the employee’s accumulated leave one pay period after it is used. For example, any leave used in November will be recorded as leave used on the December 31 paycheck information. It is the responsibility of each employee to monitor the amount of sick leave available for use. Sick leave shall not be used as vacation leave. Sick leave cannot be taken in advance, unless approved by the State Court Administrator or State Probation Administrator, up to a maximum of 40 hours.    Sick leave shall be requested in advance from the supervisor whenever possible, i.e., dental appointment or physical examination, etc.  In case of sickness, injury, emergencies, or any other absence not approved in advance, the employee shall advise his or her supervisor of the circumstances as soon as possible. If the sickness, injury, or emergency qualifies as family/medical leave the employee should submit a family/medical leave form to Personnel.    Disabilities caused or contributed to by pregnancy, miscarriage, childbirth, and recovery there from are, for all job-related purposes, temporary disabilities and will be treated as such under the rules and regulations for sick leave.    Sick leave shall be taken on a working-hour basis. An employee may be required to submit substantiating evidence when the reason for the leave request was a medical or dental appointment or when the supervisor suspects sick leave abuse. Substantiating evidence may also be required by the supervisor if the sick leave absence exceeds 3 workdays but is less than 10 workdays and does not qualify for family/medical leave.    Substantiating evidence shall be required by the supervisor if the sick leave absence is 10 workdays or longer and the employee is not on family/medical leave. Sick leave may be denied when the employee fails to substantiate the legitimate use of sick leave. When an employee is absent for 3 or more days or when a supervisor receives information that indicates the reason for the sick leave may qualify as family/medical leave, the employee shall be notified of their rights under 29 U.S.C. § 261, Family and Medical Leave Act, and given a family/medical leave form. If the employee qualifies for FMLA and the employee’s condition is a serious health condition as defined by 29 U.S.C. § 261(11), employees are required to complete a request and utilize leave options authorized under the Family and Medical Leave Act. (See additional information under Family/Medical Leave section.)     Before utilizing sick leave in conjunction with Injury Leave/Workers’ Compensation Payments, refer to “Use of Sick and/or Vacation Leave to Supplement Workers’ Compensation Payments” policy or a Human Resources professional in the AOCP.    If an employee leaves the service of the Nebraska Court System in good standing and is reemployed within 1 year from the date of separation, sick leave earned during the previous period of continuous employment shall be reinstated to the employee’s credit.    An employee who has terminated employment with the state for any reason other than disciplinary or retirement, and who returns to state employment with the Nebraska Court System within 5 years of termination, will have sick leave entitlement computed by combining prior continuous service with current continuous service, disregarding the period of absence. Sick leave is not affected by the transfer of an employee from one state agency to another.    Upon retirement under the existing Nebraska State Employees Retirement System, or upon reaching the age of retirement and voluntarily resigning in good standing, an employee shall be paid one-fourth of unused, accumulated sick leave, with the rate of payment based upon the employee’s regular pay at the time of retirement. Upon the death of an employee, the employee’s beneficiaries shall be paid one-fourth of the accumulated unused sick leave with the rate of payment based upon the employee’s regular pay at the date of death.    If an employee who retires and is paid sick leave from the Nebraska Judicial Branch or any other Nebraska State agency, and the employee subsequently returns to the Nebraska Judicial Branch for employment, the person shall be considered a new employee without any prior service when determining entitlement to and accumulation of sick leave.    The payment of one-fourth of the accumulated sick leave to an employee is limited to a onetime payment, and no employee, by virtue of reentering state employment, shall become entitled to additional payments for unused sick leave.    Employees may not be compensated for earned sick leave when they are separated from Nebraska Court System employment unless the separation is due to retirement or death.    The sick leave account of each employee shall be balanced as of the closing date of the last pay period of each calendar year. Sick leave in excess of 1,440 hours will be forfeited. Amended May 23, 2007; amended July 9, 2015; amended October 23, 2024, effective January 1, 2025.
In accordance with The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, effective August 5, 1993, it shall be the policy of the Nebraska Supreme Court to allow eligible employees, as defined herein, to take up to 12 weeks of paid or unpaid, job-protected leave (hereinafter family leave) each year for family and medical reasons as specified below. Accumulated sick leave and compensatory time will be required to be used before going on an unpaid leave status. Employees may also choose to use vacation leave after their sick leave is exhausted before going on an unpaid leave status.  Total paid and unpaid leave time taken for family leave is limited to 12 weeks within a 12-month period, starting with the date the employee first uses family leave.     Sick leave absences due to a serious health condition of the employee or immediate family member will be counted toward the employee's 12-week-per-year family leave allotment.  Employees may use sick leave beyond the 12-week family leave limitation for appropriate sick leave reasons with proper certification from a health care provider.    For purposes of this family leave policy, an "eligible" employee shall mean an employee who has at least 12 months of service and has worked at least 1,250 hours in the 12-month period preceding the start of the leave.    "Job-protected" leave shall mean that upon return from family leave, the employee shall be returned to his or her original position, or to an equivalent position with equivalent pay, benefits, and other terms and conditions of employment. However, an employee's "service date" (the date used to determine amounts of vacation and sick leave) shall be adjusted when an unpaid absence due to family leave exceeds 14 consecutive calendar days.    An eligible employee shall be entitled to family leave and will be required to use family leave for one or more of the following reasons: 1. the birth of a child of the employee; 2. the adoption of a child or placement of a foster care child with the employee; 3. in order to care for a member of the employee's immediate family (defined as spouse, child, or parent) who has a serious health condition; or 4. a serious health condition of the employee that makes the employee unable to perform his or her job.    An employee must provide at least 30 days' notice to the Administrative Office before family leave is to begin if the need for such leave is foreseeable. Where the need for such leave is not foreseeable, notice must be given as soon as possible and practical. Employees are also required to inform their supervisor of the need for family/medical leave as soon as possible.    The term "serious health condition" means an illness, injury, impairment, or physical mental condition that involves (a) inpatient care in a hospital, hospice, or residential medical care facility, or (b) continuing treatment by a health care provider.    A request for family leave based on the serious health condition of the employee or his or her spouse, child, or parent must be supported by a medical certificate issued by the health care provider of the employee or the employee's family member. The medical certification must include the following information: 1.  The date on which the serious health condition commenced and the probable duration of the condition; and 2.  The diagnosis of the serious health condition; and 3.  A statement containing specific information explaining either: a.  why the employee is needed to care for the child, spouse, or parent; or, b.  why the employee is unable to perform the functions of his or her job. 4.  If the leave is to be intermittent, a statement containing specific information concerning planned medical treatments, including the expected dates and the duration of such treatments.    In addition, upon the employee's return to work after his or her own serious health condition, the employee shall provide the health care provider's "fitness-for-duty" certification only if the absence was due to a job related injury or illness.    If the Administrative Office questions the adequacy of medical certifications referred to above, a second opinion may be required at the Administrative Office's expense, by a health care provider designated by the Administrative Office. If that second opinion differs from the first, a third opinion may be required, at the Administrative Office's expense. The third health care provider must be mutually agreed upon, and the results of the third opinion shall be final and binding.    Records and documents relating to medical certifications, recertification or medical histories of employees or employees' family members, shall be maintained in separate file/records in the Administrative Office and be treated as confidential medical records. Supervisors and managers may be informed regarding necessary restrictions on the work or duties of an employee and necessary accommodations.    For employees who have accumulated sick leave, the use of family leave will be concurrent with the use of accumulated sick leave when the reason for leave qualifies under the sick leave provision of the Nebraska Supreme Court Personnel Policies and Procedures. An employee may elect to substitute accrued vacation leave for all or part of the unpaid family leave. Nothing in this family leave policy allows an employee to substitute paid sick leave in any situation where the Nebraska Supreme Court Personnel Rules would not normally allow for such paid leave. Based on information provided by the supervisor and the employee, the Administrative Office shall be responsible for designating paid leave as family leave.    The Administrative Office may limit the total paid and unpaid leave which has been designated as family leave to 12 weeks in any 12-month period, beginning with the date the employee begins his or her family leave. Family leave is not cumulative.    Where a Nebraska Supreme Court employee has a spouse working for the court system or a state agency, the Administrative Office, at its discretion, may limit family leave to a combined total of 12 weeks of family leave if such leave is taken for the birth or adoption of a child or placement of a foster child with the employee and his or her spouse.    Family leave may be taken intermittently, after proper notice and medical certification, whenever it is medically necessary to care for a spouse, child, or parent, or when an employee, because of his or her own serious medical condition, is unable to perform the functions of the job. If the need for intermittent leave is foreseeable based on planned medical treatment, the employee is responsible for scheduling the treatment, subject to the approval of the health care provider, in a manner that does not unduly interrupt the employer's operations. When intermittent leave is requested, the employer may require the employee to transfer temporarily to an alternative job, with equivalent pay and benefits, which will better accommodate recurring periods of leave than does the employee's regular position.    Employer health insurance contributions shall continue during an employee's unpaid family leave whenever such insurance was provided before the leave was taken. Employer contributions shall be computed as if the employee had continued to work his or her regular schedule. If the health insurance plan requires employee co-payments, an employee on unpaid family leave must continue to make insurance premium payments to maintain the insurance coverage. Amended July 16, 2003; amended July 9, 2015.
