Texas Jury Duty Leave

Overview
Jury duty leave is job-protected leave. An employee who is on jury duty is entitled to protection against termination or other adverse action by the employer (see §§ [122.001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/CP/htm/CP.122.htm#122.001) and [122.0022](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/CP/htm/CP.122.htm#122.0022) of the Juror's Right to Reemployment Act in the Texas Civil Practices & Remedies Code). However, paid leave for jury duty is not required - see below.
Texas law does not currently require that jury duty leave be paid, except for those who are salaried exempt employees (see below). A bill that would have required employers to pay $40 of jury duty pay for the first day of jury service did not pass during the 81st general session of the Texas Legislature in 2009. The general rule under both Texas and federal law is that an employer does not need to pay for time not worked. That would include time spent on jury duty.

However, paid leave for jury duty is not required - see below.
Just as with military leave and leave to serve as a subpoenaed witness in a court or administrative proceeding, an employer should not count jury duty leave toward an absence limit, such as one found in a [neutral absence control policy](https://efte.twc.texas.gov/neutral_absence_control_policy.html).

If an employer does pay the regular wages or salary while an employee is serving on the jury, the law would allow the company to require the employee to turn over the jury duty pay to the company.

Specific rules apply in the special situation of exempt salaried employees. In the event of absences due to jury duty, witness duty, or temporary military duty, if an employee works any part of a week and misses the rest of the week for jury, witness, or military duty, he or she must receive the full salary for the workweek, but if they miss a full week, no pay is due for that week (see [29 C.F.R. 541.602(a)](https://efte.twc.texas.gov/salary_definition.html)); however, partial-week deductions from leave balances are allowed. Do not forget that a deduction allowed under the FLSA for a week not worked must be authorized in writing by the employee to be valid under the Texas Payday Law (see item 12 of the sample [wage deduction authorization agreement](https://efte.twc.texas.gov/wage_deduction_authorization_agreement.html) in this book). However, that special rule affects only salaried exempt employees. It does not affect non-exempt employees, or exempt employees who do not have to be paid a salary, such as doctors, lawyers, and teachers.

Coverage Election
In addition, time spent on jury duty is not time worked for purposes of the FLSA, so it would not count toward overtime. Finally, even if an employer has an optional jury duty paid leave policy, the hours so paid would not count toward overtime, just as [other types of paid leave and paid holiday hours do not count toward overtime](https://efte.twc.texas.gov/i_hours_worked_no_leave.html).
