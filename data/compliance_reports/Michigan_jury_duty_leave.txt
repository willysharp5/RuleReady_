Covered Employers
By law, an employer cannot fire, or discipline or threaten such action, against an employee who is summoned for jury duty or chosen to serve on a jury, even for a long trial. Nor can employers force a worker to go beyond normal hours to make up for time spent on jury service. An employer who takes these actions could be guilty of a misdemeanor or held in contempt of court.

What Should Employers Do?
#### What's required?
Jurors must be able to communicate in the English language and be physically and mentally able to carry out the functions of a juror.
That’s up to the court, but there are a number of grounds for excusing a person from jury service or postponing the service. “Hardship” is one, and that could include lack of transportation, excessive travel, extreme financial burden, undue risk to physical property, and being over 70. “Hardship” also includes situations where your absence from your normal routine would affect another’s care or pose a risk to public health or safety. A request for a medical related exemption requires a letter from a doctor. A full-time student who believes that jury service will conflict with his or her classes must submit a copy of the class schedule.
Be skeptical if you are told, “In order to avoid arrest (or prosecution), you must provide us with your Social Security number so we can verify who you are.”

Training Deadlines
It may sound official – and intimidating: you receive a phone call or e-mail claiming to be from a local court telling you that you missed jury duty. There is a bench warrant out for your arrest and you face 30 days in jail, but the so-called “court” offers you a way out: pay $500 by credit card.

A similar phone scam involves threatening victims with arrest for missing jury duty unless they give up personal information, such as birth dates and Social Security numbers. In yet another variation of this scam, the victim gets a text message saying that the victim is subject to arrest unless he or she calls the phone number in the text and pays by credit card. To make the demand seem plausible, the scammer often uses the name of an actual local court or court official.

Posting Requirements
That’s up to the court, but there are a number of grounds for excusing a person from jury service or postponing the service. “Hardship” is one, and that could include lack of transportation, excessive travel, extreme financial burden, undue risk to physical property, and being over 70. “Hardship” also includes situations where your absence from your normal routine would affect another’s care or pose a risk to public health or safety. A request for a medical related exemption requires a letter from a doctor. A full-time student who believes that jury service will conflict with his or her classes must submit a copy of the class schedule.

Recordkeeping Requirements
Once the judge discharges you from service, you may discuss the case with others, although you don’t have to discuss it. Attorneys in the case often find it helpful to talk to the jurors afterwards. In a high-profile case, the media may also want to talk to jurors.

Penalties for Non-Compliance
You can be held in contempt of court, fined, or even jailed.
