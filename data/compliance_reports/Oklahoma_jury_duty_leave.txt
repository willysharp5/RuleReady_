Oklahoma Jury Duty Leave

Overview
- (4) A Federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) non-exempt employee who is called to appear in court on a normally scheduled work day in accordance with paragraph (2) of this Section is entitled to compensation for that time regardless of shift. For example, an employee who works an eight-hour shift from 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. and reports to court that day will be entitled to workweek adjustment or compensatory time for his or her time in court. Since jury duty is leave and not time worked, compensatory time is only computed hour for hour. An employee who is called to appear in court on a normally scheduled day off is not entitled to compensation for that time. The day in which the majority of the shift is scheduled determines the work day for the purpose of this policy.
