OSHA has released a hazard alert directed to employers, contractors, staffing agencies and employees in the food processing industry to raise awareness regarding the alarming number of serious preventable injuries – including deaths –  the work sector is facing. The alert includes cleaning and maintenance shifts.
OSHA is withdrawing the vaccination and testing [emergency temporary standard](https://www.federalregister.gov/public-inspection/2022-01532/covid-19-vaccination-and-testing-emergency-temporary-standard) (ETS) issued on Nov. 5, 2021, to protect unvaccinated employees of large employers with 100 or more employees from workplace exposure to coronavirus. The withdrawal was effective January 26, 2022.
