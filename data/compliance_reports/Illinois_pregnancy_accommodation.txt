Overview
[Contact IDHR](https://dhr.illinois.gov/contact) for Services or Follow-Up
All Illinois residents have a right to reproductive autonomy, including freedom from discrimination based on pregnancy, childbirth, and pregnancy-related conditions. This guidance, issued in partnership with the [Office of the Illinois Attorney General](https://illinoisattorneygeneral.gov/), outlines protections, examples, and means of filing a complaint under Illinois law.

Covered Employers
- [A: Employers / Workplaces](https://dhr.illinois.gov/publications/pregnancy-rights.html#3a)
Following the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in _[Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women%27s_Health_Organization)_ to overrule Roe v. Wade, many states have rolled back the freedom of individuals to make reproductive health decisions.  In contrast to other states narrowing of civil and human rights, Illinois law protects the choice to have an abortion and treats abortion in the same manner as other kinds of healthcare.  Individuals are entitled to exercise this choice – or any other reproductive health decision – free from discrimination regardless of their sexual orientation, gender identity, race, ethnicity, immigration status, disability status, or any other protected characteristic.
The [Illinois Department of Human Rights](https://dhr.illinois.gov/) (the “IDHR”) and the [Illinois Attorney General’s Office](https://illinoisattorneygeneral.gov/) (the “OAG”) issue this non-regulatory guidance to clarify Illinois law as it relates to pregnancy and related reproductive health decisions, and to identify protections from pregnancy discrimination that exist in Illinois. The guidance is intended for Illinois residents, employers, housing providers, and the business and healthcare communities to better understand their rights and responsibilities concerning reproductive autonomy and to refrain from discrimination in these contexts.

Covered Employees
The Act specifically requires employers to make reasonable accommodations for an employee’s pregnancy, childbirth, and related medical or common conditions. Failure to accommodate on the basis of pregnancy is specifically prohibited under the Act.  In other contexts, such as public accommodations and housing, a refusal to provide accommodations for pregnancy, childbirth, or related conditions may also constitute unlawful discrimination under the Act.
Discrimination against employees because of their pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical or common conditions is a civil rights violation under the Act. This includes matters such as hiring, firing, pay, job assignments, promotions, and other terms and conditions of employment.  Employees who are affected by pregnancy, childbirth, or other related conditions must be treated the same as other employees who are similar in their ability to work.
The prohibitions against pregnancy discrimination are broadly interpreted to give full effect to the purpose of the Act. As a result, the Act’s workplace protections reach beyond the condition of actual pregnancy to cover non-pregnant employees with capacity to become pregnant.  An employer is prohibited from discriminating against an employee by failing to hire, disciplining, terminating, or harassing an employee because they may become pregnant in the future, or making assumptions or stereotyping an employee about what type of work they are capable of because of their pregnancy or their ability to become pregnant in the future.

What Should Employers Do?
The Act specifically requires employers to make reasonable accommodations for an employee’s pregnancy, childbirth, and related medical or common conditions. Failure to accommodate on the basis of pregnancy is specifically prohibited under the Act.  In other contexts, such as public accommodations and housing, a refusal to provide accommodations for pregnancy, childbirth, or related conditions may also constitute unlawful discrimination under the Act.
Discrimination against employees because of their pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical or common conditions is a civil rights violation under the Act. This includes matters such as hiring, firing, pay, job assignments, promotions, and other terms and conditions of employment.  Employees who are affected by pregnancy, childbirth, or other related conditions must be treated the same as other employees who are similar in their ability to work.
The Act’s protections from pregnancy discrimination also encompass the right to make reproductive health and family planning decisions, such as use or non-use of contraception, fertility treatments, and abortion.  This means an employer may not take adverse action against an employee for choosing to use or not use contraception, terminating an unplanned pregnancy, or seeking treatment for fertility issues, and an employer may not require an employee to engage in any of the above to obtain or retain employment. Adverse actions include, but are not limited to failing to hire, discipline, terminating or harassing an employee. An employer is also prohibited from retaliating against an employee for exercising their rights under the Act or making a complaint.
Finally, employment discrimination based on failure to reasonably accommodate an employee on the basis of pregnancy is specifically prohibited under the Act.  Under the Act, if an employee has a pregnancy-related medical condition and needs a reasonable accommodation to do their job, the employer must accommodate the employee if it is not an undue hardship on the employer. To do this, the employee and employer must both participate in an interactive process to try to find a reasonable accommodation that enables the pregnant employee to perform the essential functions of their position but does not place too great a burden on the employer. Each situation is decided on an individual basis, taking into consideration the type of work, the requested accommodation, and the employer’s size, among other factors.

Special Requirements
The Act specifically requires employers to make reasonable accommodations for an employee’s pregnancy, childbirth, and related medical or common conditions. Failure to accommodate on the basis of pregnancy is specifically prohibited under the Act.  In other contexts, such as public accommodations and housing, a refusal to provide accommodations for pregnancy, childbirth, or related conditions may also constitute unlawful discrimination under the Act.
Finally, employment discrimination based on failure to reasonably accommodate an employee on the basis of pregnancy is specifically prohibited under the Act.  Under the Act, if an employee has a pregnancy-related medical condition and needs a reasonable accommodation to do their job, the employer must accommodate the employee if it is not an undue hardship on the employer. To do this, the employee and employer must both participate in an interactive process to try to find a reasonable accommodation that enables the pregnant employee to perform the essential functions of their position but does not place too great a burden on the employer. Each situation is decided on an individual basis, taking into consideration the type of work, the requested accommodation, and the employer’s size, among other factors.
Certain exceptions apply to medical, dental, or other health care professionals, as well as to private professional service providers such as lawyers, accountants or insurance agents. These professionals are not considered to have committed a civil rights violation if they refer an individual to other service providers or refuse to treat or provide services to an individual for a non-discriminatory reason. So long as the professional would also refer or refuse to treat or provide services to all individuals who sought the same treatment or service, they do not violate the Act.

Reciprocity/Extraterritorial Coverage
Following the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in _[Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women%27s_Health_Organization)_ to overrule Roe v.

The Illinois Human Rights Act provides broad civil rights protections throughout Illinois in the areas of employment, real estate transactions (housing), financial credit, and places of public accommodation. The IDHR is charged with enforcing the Act by securing for all individuals in Illinois freedom from unlawful discrimination and establishing equal opportunity and affirmative action as the policies of the State.  The OAG has authority to enforce the Act when any person or group of people engages in a pattern or practice of discrimination prohibited by the Act.
