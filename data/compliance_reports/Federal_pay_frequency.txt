Federal Pay Frequency & Payday Timing

Overview
The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) provides leadership on pay administration for civilian Federal employees. We accomplish this by developing and maintaining Governmentwide regulations and policies on authorities such as basic pay setting, locality pay, special rates, back pay, pay limitations, premium pay, grade and pay retention, severance pay, and recruitment, relocation, and retention incentives. Ultimately, each Federal agency is responsible for complying with the law and regulations and following OPM's policies and guidance to administer pay policies and programs for its own employees.

What Should Employers Do?
Under 5 U.S.C. 5538, employing agencies must pay differential payments to eligible Federal civilian employees who are members of the Reserve or National Guard (hereafter referred to as "reservists") called or ordered to active duty under certain specified provisions of law. Federal agencies must provide a payment (a "reservist differential") equal to the amount by which an employee's projected civilian "basic pay" for a covered pay period exceeds the employee's actual military "pay and allowances" allocable to that pay period.
The employee-reservist must provide their employing agency with a copy of their military orders. The employing agency will determine whether the employee-reservist meets the conditions described above.
The receipt of a reservist differential does not affect an employee’s civilian pay and leave status. While absent from the civilian job, the employee is considered to be on leave without pay unless the employee takes civilian paid leave or other paid time off. The employee may use paid time off (e.g., military leave, annual leave, credit hours, compensatory time off), as available to the employee, subject to the normal conditions governing use of the particular paid time off. However, as required by 5 U.S.C. 6323(b), sick leave may not be used during a period of duty as a reservist that meets the conditions in that subsection.  A reservist may not receive the reservist differential for periods during which he or she uses paid time off, since the reservist is already receiving full civilian pay for such periods. (During civilian paid time off, the reservist receives full military pay and full civilian pay, except that civilian pay is offset by military pay when an employee uses military leave under 5 U.S.C. 6323(b). During civilian leave without pay periods, the reservist receives full military pay and may receive a reservist differential, which represents the amount by which civilian basic pay exceeds military pay and allowances.) Thus, the reservist differential for a pay period will be adjusted to account for any hours of paid time off.
2. Special military leave for contingency operations or law enforcement purposes under 5 U.S.C. 6323(b) - providing up to 22 days of leave each calendar year but with civilian pay offset by the amount of military pay allocated to those leave days, as required by 5 U.S.C. 5519.

2. Special military leave for contingency operations or law enforcement purposes under 5 U.S.C. 6323(b) - providing up to 22 days of leave each calendar year but with civilian pay offset by the amount of military pay allocated to those leave days, as required by 5 U.S.C. 5519.

Penalties for Non-Compliance
The employing agency must determine the projected gross amount of civilian "basic pay" that would otherwise have been payable to an employee for each pay period within a qualifying period if the employee's civilian employment had not been interrupted by military active duty. Only "basic pay" as defined in OPM guidance is considered.
This waiver authority applies to certain civilian employees who perform work while in an overseas location that (1) is in the area of responsibility of the United States Central Command (CENTCOM) or (2) was formerly in the CENTCOM area of responsibility but has been moved to the area of responsibility of the Commander of the United States Africa Command (AFRICOM). The overseas work must meet one of two additional qualifying conditions: (1) performance of work in direct support of or directly related to a military operation (including a contingency operation as defined in 10 U.S.C. 101(a)(13)), or (2) performance of work in direct support of or directly related to an operation in response to an emergency declared by the President.
5. Under section 1106 of Public Law 111-84, the head of an agency may waive the premium pay cap provisions under 5 U.S.C. 5547 in calendar year 2010 for an employee who performs work while in an overseas location that (1) is in the area of responsibility of the Commander of the United States Central Command (CENTCOM) or (2) was formerly in the CENTCOM area of responsibility but has been moved to the area of responsibility of the Commander of the United States Africa Command (AFRICOM). The overseas work must meet one of two additional qualifying conditions: (1) performance of work in direct support of or directly related to a military operation (including a contingency operation as defined in 10 U.S.C. 101(a)(13)) or (2) performance of work in direct support of or directly related to an operation in response to an emergency declared by the President. Under the waiver authority, a covered employee may receive premium pay in calendar year 2010 to the extent that such premium pay would not cause the employee's aggregate amount of basic pay and premium pay payable in calendar year 2010 to exceed $230,700.
5. Under section 1101(a) of Public Law 110-417, the head of an agency may waive the premium pay cap provisions under 5 U.S.C. 5547 in calendar year 2009 for an employee who performs work while in an overseas location that (1) is in the area of responsibility of the Commander of the United States Central Command (CENTCOM) or (2) was formerly in the CENTCOM area of responsibility but has been moved to the area of responsibility of the Commander of the United States Africa Command (AFRICOM). The qualifying overseas work must meet one of two additional qualifying conditions: (1) performance of work in direct support of or directly related to a military operation (including a contingency operation as defined in 10 U.S.C. 101(a)(13)) or (2) performance of work in direct support of or directly related to an operation in response to an emergency declared by the President. Under the waiver authority, a covered employee may receive premium pay in calendar year 2009 to the extent that such premium pay would not cause the employee's aggregate amount of basic pay and premium pay payable in calendar year 2009 to exceed $227,300.(See [CPM 2008-19](http://www.chcoc.gov/Transmittals/TransmittalDetails.aspx?TransmittalID=1690).)
