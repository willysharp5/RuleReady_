Maine Overtime & Hours

Overview
Maine state statute recognizes the exemption from overtime for people working in a "bona fide executive, administrative or professional capacity" and requires that employers pay a salary according to the requirements of the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).
Both Maine and federal law use a three-pronged test to determine if an employee is exempt from the overtime provisions of the law.  The three prongs of the test are:

Covered Employers
Maine state statute recognizes the exemption from overtime for people working in a "bona fide executive, administrative or professional capacity" and requires that employers pay a salary according to the requirements of the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).
As a first step, employers should review the job duties currently being performed by their employees—not only job titles or job descriptions—who fall into the salary range between the old and new exempt thresholds. Employers who have questions are encouraged to reach out to their employment compliance advisors.
- The FLSA has “enterprise and individual coverages” to determine whether a business is subject to the law; however, Maine labor laws do not have such thresholds. _Any business operating in the state with one employee is automatically covered by state law._ This includes all public and private employers regardless of profit or size.

What Should Employers Do?
Maine state statute recognizes the exemption from overtime for people working in a "bona fide executive, administrative or professional capacity" and requires that employers pay a salary according to the requirements of the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).
- Maine statutes incorporate by reference the salary requirements under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).
As of January 1, 2023, the minimum salary amount is $796.17 per week or $41,401 per year for exempting a worker from overtime. This is only one of the factors used in determining whether a worker is exempt from overtime under federal or state law. The duties of each worker must be considered as part of this analysis. Failure to adhere to both requirements—meeting the duties test and the weekly salary threshold—will result in violations of both federal or state law or of one jurisdiction or the other depending on the discrepancies in the laws.

Employers seeking legal guidance should contact employment compliance advisors.
- **Qualifying Example:** Insurance Claims Adjuster; financial employees who collect and analyze info regarding customer income, assets, investments, debts; or an executive assistant or administrative assistant to a business owner or senior executive of a large business generally meet the duties requirements for the administrative exemption if such employee, without specific instructions or prescribed procedures, has been delegated authority regarding matters of significance. Purchasing agents with authority to bind the company on significant purchases, and Human Resources managers who formulate, interpret or implement employment policies and management consultants who study the operations of a business and propose changes in organization generally meet the duties requirements for the administrative exemption.
- **Qualifying Example:** An employee's primary duty must be the performance of work requiring advanced knowledge in a field of science or learning customarily acquired by a prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction such as those of a teacher, doctor, accountant or lawyer.

Training Deadlines
MDOL has several [Wage and Hour Compliance Assistance classes](http://www.maine.gov/tools/whatsnew/index.php?topic=Safetyworks_Classes&v=ListAll) scheduled all over the state and we are scheduling additional sessions over the next six months. If you are interested in attending a class, would like a class in your area, or have general overtime questions, please email [bls.mdol@maine.gov](mailto:bls.mdol@maine.gov).
Any employer, public or private sector, may allow a worker to adjust or flex his or her schedule within the work week so as not to go over 40 hours. For example, a worker who works 10 hours on Monday may be allowed to only work six hours on Friday within the same work week to keep the total hours at or below 40 for that same work week.
A: Under both federal and state law, when an individual is employed by the same employer and performs work at two or more locations, all hours must be combined within the work week. The employee must be compensated at a rate not less than one and one-half their regular rate of pay for working beyond the 40-hour work week. Maintaining separate payroll records based on location could result in a failure to pay overtime.

Qualified Trainers
- **Non-Qualifying Example:** While a Certified Public Accountant generally meets the exemption, accounting clerks, bookkeepers and other employees who normally perform a great deal of routine work generally will not qualify as exempt professionals. Paralegals and legal assistants generally do not qualify as exempt professionals because an advanced specialized academic degree is not a standard prerequisite for entry into the field. Although many paralegals possess general four-year advanced degrees, most specialized paralegal programs are two-year Associate Degree programs from a community college or equivalent institution.

Special Requirements
- Maine employers need to review both federal and state labor laws on each particular exemption to determine applicability. Some exemptions are allowed under federal law but our state law prohibits the exemption or does not address it.
- **Qualifying Example:** Insurance Claims Adjuster; financial employees who collect and analyze info regarding customer income, assets, investments, debts; or an executive assistant or administrative assistant to a business owner or senior executive of a large business generally meet the duties requirements for the administrative exemption if such employee, without specific instructions or prescribed procedures, has been delegated authority regarding matters of significance. Purchasing agents with authority to bind the company on significant purchases, and Human Resources managers who formulate, interpret or implement employment policies and management consultants who study the operations of a business and propose changes in organization generally meet the duties requirements for the administrative exemption.
- **Qualifying Example:** An employee's primary duty must be the performance of work requiring advanced knowledge in a field of science or learning customarily acquired by a prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction such as those of a teacher, doctor, accountant or lawyer.

Coverage Election
- **Non-Qualifying Example:** A relief supervisor or working supervisor whose primary duty is performing nonexempt work on the production line in a manufacturing plant does not become exempt merely because the nonexempt production line employee occasionally has some responsibility for directing the work of other nonexempt production line employees when, for example, the exempt supervisor is unavailable. Similarly, an employee whose primary duty is to work as an electrician is not an exempt executive even if the employee also directs the work of other employees on the job site, orders parts and materials for the job, and handles requests from the prime contractor. Generally, an employee whose primary duty is ordinary production work or routine, recurrent or repetitive tasks cannot qualify for exemption as an executive.
A: Employers have a range of options for responding to the updated standard salary level. First, employers may increase the salary of an employee who meets the duties test to at least the new salary level to retain his or her exempt status. If an employer chooses not to take that option, for an affected employee newly entitled to overtime pay, employers may:

A: Unless specifically exempted, employees covered by Maine’s overtime statute must receive pay for hours worked in excess of 40 in a work week at a rate not less than one and one-half their regular rates of pay. This is referred to as "overtime" pay.

Employer Notification Requirements
If they haven’t done so already, employers are strongly advised to conduct their own classification analysis to review those employees for whom they currently claim overtime exemptions and decide whether to:
- **Non-Qualifying Example:** Personnel clerks who “screen” applicants or individuals performing ordinary inspection work do not qualify for the administrative exemption because the work involves the use of skills and technical abilities in gathering factual information, applying known standards or prescribed procedures, determining which procedure to follow, or determining whether prescribed standards or criteria are met.

Posting Requirements
Not specified in available documentation

Recordkeeping Requirements
- **Non-Qualifying Example:** While a Certified Public Accountant generally meets the exemption, accounting clerks, bookkeepers and other employees who normally perform a great deal of routine work generally will not qualify as exempt professionals. Paralegals and legal assistants generally do not qualify as exempt professionals because an advanced specialized academic degree is not a standard prerequisite for entry into the field. Although many paralegals possess general four-year advanced degrees, most specialized paralegal programs are two-year Associate Degree programs from a community college or equivalent institution.
A: The FLSA establishes minimum wage, overtime pay, recordkeeping, and youth employment standards affecting employees in the private sector and in federal, state, and local governments. Covered nonexempt workers are entitled to a minimum wage and overtime pay at a rate not less than one and one-half times the regular rate of pay when an employee works more than 40 hours of work in a work week.
Any employer, public or private sector, may allow a worker to adjust or flex his or her schedule within the work week so as not to go over 40 hours. For example, a worker who works 10 hours on Monday may be allowed to only work six hours on Friday within the same work week to keep the total hours at or below 40 for that same work week.

Penalties for Non-Compliance
As of January 1, 2023, the minimum salary amount is $796.17 per week or $41,401 per year for exempting a worker from overtime. This is only one of the factors used in determining whether a worker is exempt from overtime under federal or state law. The duties of each worker must be considered as part of this analysis. Failure to adhere to both requirements—meeting the duties test and the weekly salary threshold—will result in violations of both federal or state law or of one jurisdiction or the other depending on the discrepancies in the laws.
A: Both federal and state law defines the term “employ” to mean “to suffer or permit to work.” Those who are “suffered or permitted” to work must be compensated under the law for the services they perform. Employers who know or who have reason to know that an employee is working beyond the 40-hour work week, must account for those hours and pay requisite overtime if applicable. This includes overtime worked without pre-approval even when it goes against the company policy.
A: Yes. Both federal and state law defines the term “employ” to mean “to suffer or permit to work.” Those who are “suffered or permitted” to work must be compensated under the law for the services they perform. In the event that an employee is working overtime to meet job duties, employers can be held liable for overtime wages. Employers who know or who have reason to know that an employee is working beyond the 40-hour work week must account for those hours and pay requisite overtime.
When it comes to employees answering phone calls or checking email after hours, this is clearly work time and must be recorded and compensated as such. Employers should have clear policies that indicate which employees are allowed to perform work after hours and if employees violate the policy, they should be counseled for the violation of that policy but must still be compensated.
