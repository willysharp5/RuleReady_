Covered Employers
to amend the South Carolina Code of Laws By ENACTING the "Workforce Opportunity Act"; and by adding Section [41-1-45](https://www.scstatehouse.gov/code/t41c001.php#41-1-45) so as to PROVIDE THAT THE STATE MAY NOT INQUIRE, CONSIDER, OR REQUIRE DISCLOSURE OF THE CRIMINAL RECORD OR CRIMINAL HISTORY OF AN APPLICANT FOR EMPLOYMENT UNTIL THE APPLICANT IS SELECTED FOR AN INTERVIEW BY THE EMPLOYER OR BEFORE A CONDITIONAL OFFER OF EMPLOYMENT IS MADE TO THE APPLICANT, TO PROVIDE EXCEPTIONS, AND TO PROVIDE RELATED DEFINITIONS AND PROCEDURES, AMONG OTHER THINGS.
