New Jersey Prevailing Wage Laws (public contracts)

Overview
The [New Jersey Prevailing Wage Act](https://www.nj.gov/labor/wageandhour/tools-resources/laws/prevailingwageact.shtml) (N.J.S.A. 34:11-56.25 et seq.) establishes a prevailing wage level for workers engaged in public works in order to safeguard the worker’s efficiency and general well-being, and to protect them as well as their employers from the effects of serious and unfair competition resulting from wage levels that are detrimental to the efficiency and well-being of all concerned.
The Act requires the payment of minimum rates of pay to laborers, craftsmen, and apprentices employed on public works projects. Covered workers must receive the appropriate craft prevailing wage rate as determined by the Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development.

Covered Employers
The [New Jersey Prevailing Wage Act](https://www.nj.gov/labor/wageandhour/tools-resources/laws/prevailingwageact.shtml) (N.J.S.A. 34:11-56.25 et seq.) establishes a prevailing wage level for workers engaged in public works in order to safeguard the worker’s efficiency and general well-being, and to protect them as well as their employers from the effects of serious and unfair competition resulting from wage levels that are detrimental to the efficiency and well-being of all concerned.
All contractors and subcontractors performing public work for a public body shall post the prevailing wage rates for each craft and classification, including the effective date of any changes to the rate, in a prominent and easily accessible place at the site of the work or at such places that are used by employers to pay workers their wages.
Effective February 18, 1992, Regulation N.J.A.C. 12:60-2.1 and 6.1 of the New Jersey Prevailing Wage Act, N.J.S.A. 34:11-56.25 et. seq. requires that certified payroll records must be submitted to the public body, by all contractors and subcontractors, for each employee on the project within ten (10) days of the payment of wages. The public body shall receive, file, and make available for inspection during normal business hours the certified payroll records. Contractors and subcontractors can use [the payroll Certification for Public Works Projects Form (MW-562)](https://www.nj.gov/labor/wageandhour/assets/PDFs/wagehub/MW-562%20%286-23%29%20PayrollCert-PublicWorks.pdf) or they can submit certified payroll online to the Department using the [New Jersey Wage Hub](https://njwages.nj.gov/). This would be optional, however, the advantage to the contractor or subcontractor is that _where the public body_ for which the public work was performed _has also registered_ with the Department for use of the New Jersey Wage Hub (as a common repository for certified payroll records), submission by the contractor or subcontractor of the certified payroll records to the New Jersey Wage Hub alone will be considered by the Department to satisfy the requirements of N.J.A.C. 12:60-5.1(c) described above.

What Should Employers Do?
The Act requires the payment of minimum rates of pay to laborers, craftsmen, and apprentices employed on public works projects. Covered workers must receive the appropriate craft prevailing wage rate as determined by the Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development.
Public works projects subject to the Act are those funded in whole or in part with the funds of a public body. Contracts awarded directly by municipal government must be valued at $16,263 or more to be covered by the Act. For all other public entities, including municipal utility authorities and boards of education, the threshold is $2,000.
Anyone interested in bidding on or engaging in any contract (or part thereof) for public work which is subject to the provisions of the Prevailing Wage Act must register with the Division of Wage and Hour Compliance as required by the Public Works Contractor Registration Act (PWCRA) P.L. 1999, c.238-N.J.S.A. 34:11-56.48 et seq., which establishes a unified procedure for the registration of contractors and subcontractors engaged in public works building projects. The PWCRA requires an annual registration fee of $300. After successful completion of two consecutive years of registration, a contractor may elect to register for a two-year period and pay a registration fee of $500.
Upon registration, the contractor and/or subcontractor will be issued a certificate indicating compliance with the requirements of the Act. Public bodies are expected to require proof of registration of all contractors bidding on the project and all subcontractors identified in such bids.
