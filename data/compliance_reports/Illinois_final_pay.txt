Training Deadlines
If an employer has a vacation policy, which allows employees to take reasonable amount of vacation during the course of the calendar year subject to business needs and the employee's own judgment and the policy does not provide for the employee receiving a defined number of days after a defined period of employment, is the employer obligated to pay an employee who separates from employment a monetary equivalent equal to the amount of vacation pay to which the employee would otherwise have been allowed to take during that year but had not taken?
**Example 1:** The company has a policy that provides for five days of paid vacation after one year of service and all vacation not used shall be forfeited at time of termination. The employee completes one year of service as of July 1, and leaves employment on October 1, without having taken any vacation. Upon separation the employer must pay the employee the monetary equivalent of five days' vacation pay for the vacation earned as of July 1, and the pro rata vacation earned for the months of July through September. Since the employee worked three out of twelve months or 3/12 or 25% of the twelve-month period after July 1 and the employer must pay the employee pro rata vacation for the period notwithstanding the terms of the written policy.
**Example 2:** The company has a policy that provides that vacation is computed as January 1 of each year based upon service completed as of January 1. The company's vacation schedule states that employees who complete six months of service as of January 1st of each year shall receive one week and employees who have completed one year of service as of January 1 shall receive two weeks of vacation. Employee A has completed seven months of employment as of January 1 and separates from employment on the following July 1. Employee A has taken five days of paid vacation after January 1. Upon separation the employer must pay the employee the monetary equivalent of five-days' vacation pay even though the employee was not employed as of the following January 1, but notwithstanding the policy, Employee A is entitled to pro rata vacation for the period following January 1. Employee A has received all vacation earned as of the prior January 1, but the employee has earned vacation pay for the months of January through June (6 months) or 6/12 or 50% of the ten days the employee would have been entitled to receive on the following January 1.
