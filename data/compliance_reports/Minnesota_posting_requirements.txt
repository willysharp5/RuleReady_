Minnesota Posting Requirements

Overview
A number of federal and state laws require that employers post certain notices in places on the company’s premises where employees are likely to see them - bulletin boards, entrances and time clocks and other conspicuous places.
Posting requirements vary by statute. Not all employers are covered by the U.S. Department of Labor’s (DOL) statutes and may not be required to post a specific notice. For example, small businesses not be covered by the Family and Medical Leave Act would not be subject to the FMLA’s posting requirements. The DOL's Employment Laws Assistance for Workers & Small Businesses offers thorough guidance. Visit their elaws [_FirstStep_ Poster Advisor](https://webapps.dol.gov/elaws/posters.htm).

Training Requirements
Employers are required to provide to persons entitled to rights and benefits under USERRA, a notice of the rights, benefits and obligations of such persons and such employers under USERRA. Employers may provide the notice, “Your Rights Under USERRA”, by posting it where employee notices are customarily placed. However, employers are free to provide the notice to employees in other ways that will minimize costs while ensuring that the full text of the notice is provided (e.g. by handling or mailing out the notice, or distributing the notice via electronic mail). Posters and information are available from the U.S. Department of Labor, Veterans’ Employment and Training Services, at [Your Rights Under USERRA](https://www.dol.gov/vets/programs/userra/poster.htm).
