Indiana E-Verify / Employment Verification

Overview
- Employers must complete and retain this page when an employee requires reverification of their employment authorization or, in some cases, employment authorization document, or if the employer chooses to document a rehire.
- Employers do not need to print, provide, or retain this page with an employee’s Form I-9 unless and until an employee requires reverification or the employer chooses to document a rehire.

Covered Employers
Use Form I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification, to verify the identity and employment authorization of individuals hired for employment in the United States. All U.S. employers must properly complete Form I-9 for every individual they hire for employment in the United States. This includes citizens and aliens. Both employees and employers (or authorized representatives of the employer) must complete the form.
On the form, an employee must attest to their employment authorization. The employee must also present their employer with acceptable documents as evidence of identity and employment authorization. The employer must examine these documents to determine whether they reasonably appear to be genuine and relate to the employee, then record the document information on the employee’s Form I-9. Certain employers who choose to remotely examine the employee’s documentation under a DHS-authorized alternative procedure rather than via physical examination must indicate they did so by checking the box provided. For more information, review the Special Instructions tab below.

Employers and employees using this fillable form must print and manually sign it rather than typing or electronically affixing a signature because this fillable form does not meet DHS standards for electronic Form I-9 generation, storage and retention systems. See 8 CFR section 274a.2. Failure to meet DHS standards for electronically generated, stored and/or retained Form I-9 may result in fines and other penalties.
