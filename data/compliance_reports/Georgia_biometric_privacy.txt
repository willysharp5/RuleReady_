Georgia Biometric Privacy / AI Use Laws (emerging)

Overview
Generative AI presents additional considerations. In collaboration with the AI Council, GTA is preparing guidelines for state government’s use of generative AI, but in the meantime, please be aware of areas where particular care is warranted. The guidance below applies to all employees, contractors, and third parties who use AI tools on behalf of your organization.
While AI capabilities for recording and transcribing virtual meetings offer convenience, they should be used thoughtfully. Agencies must ensure that the use of AI tools in virtual meetings complies with all relevant laws and regulations, including those related to data protection, intellectual property, and labor laws. AI should not be used to manipulate or misrepresent the contributions of participants. Be mindful of the potential for AI to misinterpret or misrepresent human communication. AI outputs should be used only to supplement, not replace, human judgment.

Employees are required to seek [authorization](https://gta.georgia.gov/ai-application-and-tool-requests)from GTA to use any third-party GenAI toolsets, including large language models (LLMs). While LLMs like OpenAI or ChatGPT can boost convenience and efficiency, they also present risks in the form of misinformation, bias, and threats to cybersecurity.
Employees must not enter non-public information into LLMs; any data entered an LLM _becomes_ public as it is accessible to anyone using the tool. Below is a non-exhaustive list of information types that must not be used in LLMs:

Further, there are storage and cost considerations associated with maintaining recordings. Meeting organizers are responsible for determining the need for recordings and automated transcriptions and keeping any records created.
