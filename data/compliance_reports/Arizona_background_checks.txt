In September 2015, the City of Glendale banned the box on City job applications. Background checks will only be conducted after a conditional offer of employment has been extended to an applicant. Additionally, background checks can only provide data on convictions that occurred seven years or less prior to the date of the request.
In November 2015, Pima County’s Board of Supervisors passed a resolution banning the box from County employment applications, with the exception of certain career fields. Background checks will be conducted at a later stage in the hiring process.
