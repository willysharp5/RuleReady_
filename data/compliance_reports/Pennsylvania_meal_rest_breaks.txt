Pennsylvania Meal & Rest Breaks

Overview
In 2012 Act 109 amended provisions of the Pennsylvania Minimum Wage Act. The amendment adopts the federal Fair Labor Standards Act’s “8 and 80” rule for individuals employed in hospitals or establishments primarily engaged in the care of the sick, aged, or mentally ill people. Under the 8 and 80 system, employers and employees can agree to calculate overtime on a 14-day, 80-hour work period rather than the traditional 40-hour workweek. Therefore, overtime wages are required when an employee works in excess of 8 hours in any workday and more than 80 hours in a 14-day work period.
Just because you are paid a salary does not mean that you are not entitled to receive overtime. Some employees are exempt from overtime, such as executive, administrative, and professional employees, as well as supervisors who are employed solely to supervise. Your actual daily job duties and what your employment contract states determine if you are eligible for overtime.

Your employer may order you to work overtime. Your employer may discipline or terminate you if you refuse to work overtime.

However, collective bargaining agreements may specifically govern this issue.
Not by law. It depends on your employer's policy regarding the payment of holiday pay.

You could receive straight time for eight hours of work and straight time for eight hours of holiday pay. You are not entitled to overtime pay just because you work a holiday.

Covered Employees

Training Requirements
If you have borrowed money from a third party, you can give the employer written permission to deduct payments from your earnings. If your employer has loaned you funds, it can deduct the amount from your earnings as long as you have given written authorization. Of course, normal tax deductions must be made. You must give written authorization to your employer to make such non-tax related deductions. It is not valid to sign a "blanket" authorization at the time of hire to cover any future deductions. Further, as a rule, deductions cannot reduce your gross pay below minimum wage, and the deductions must be for the employee's benefit.

There is no Pennsylvania labor law which requires an employer to pay an employee not to work. Benefits like sick leave, vacation pay and severance pay are payments to an employee not to be at work. Therefore, an employer only has to pay these benefits if the employer has a policy to pay such benefits or a contract with you to pay these benefits. An employer must follow its own rules for these kinds of payments. There may also be federal requirements governing leave that has to be provided under the Americans with Disabilities Act and Family Medical Leave Act. There may be additional requirements for certain persons within the City of Philadelphia. You can find information on the City of Philadelphia [city government website](http://www.phila.gov/MDO/Documents/paidsickleave.pdf). The Pennsylvania Department of Labor & Industry does not enforce city ordinances. You must contact the City of Philadelphia.
If you were not paid at least the minimum wage or you were not paid correctly for your overtime hours, you should try to file a wage claim within two years from the date the work was actually performed. However, you should file a claim as soon as you can. Since your employer is only required to keep its records for three years, it is more difficult for the Department of Labor & Industry to collect your wages as time passes.

This depends on the particular situation. Some on-call time is required to be paid and some is not. When trying to determine if you need to be paid while on call, you need to look at your freedom to pursue your own interests while "on call." If you are required to carry a beeper but are free to pursue your own interests, you would not be required to be paid until you had to respond to a call. If you are required to remain at your employer's place of business and are not allowed to pursue your own interests such as reading, visiting with others, listening to the radio, etc., your employer would be required to pay for this on-call time.

Yes, as long as you are given prior notice of the change prior to when it takes effect and the rate of pay does not fall below the minimum wage. It may be best practice to announce a change a pay period before.
Except for delayed implementation of new minimum wage rates, the Minimum Wage Act makes no distinction between full-time, part-time and temporary employees. Some employers who provide benefits to full time workers may not provide the same benefits to their part-time or temporary employees. If you are not a full-time employee and you want to know if you are entitled to benefits, you will need to discuss this with your employer. An employer should have set guidelines to establish who qualifies for benefits and who does not.

Pennsylvania is an ' _**AT WILL**_' state. An employer does not need to give a reason to fire an employee under Pennsylvania wage and hour laws. However, you may wish to check with an attorney to see whether or not you can file a civil lawsuit against your employer for wrongful discharge. Also, if you feel you were discriminated against because of race, creed, color, age, religion, sex, or similar reason, you may wish to contact the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission at 1-717-787-4410.
