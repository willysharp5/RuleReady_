Maryland Overtime & Hours

Overview
Overtime is payment to an employee of one and one-half (1.5) times the regular hourly wage for work performed in excess of 40 hours in a 7-day week. For some occupations in Maryland, overtime is calculated based on a different period of time. Certain farm workers, for example, receive overtime for hours worked over 60 in a week. However, under state and federal laws, some employers are exempt from the requirement to pay overtime, and some employees are exempt from the right to receive it.
Leave hours, including vacation, sick time, holiday, etc., are not counted toward the accumulated hours in a week for overtime purposes. Overtime is calculated on hours actually worked.
