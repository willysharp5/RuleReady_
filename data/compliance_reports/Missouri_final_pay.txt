Missouri Final Pay / Vacation Payout

Overview
Employers are not required to provide vacation pay, holiday pay, or severance pay — these are benefits given at an employer’s discretion. The exception would be instances where an employer has entered into a contract where certain benefits are established by agreement. If an employer does not follow their policy, the employee has the option of filing a private right of action against the employer in small claims court.
