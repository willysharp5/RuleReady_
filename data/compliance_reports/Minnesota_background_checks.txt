Minnesota Background Check / Ban-the-Box

Overview
To help end discrimination against people with criminal records, the Minnesota Department of Human Rights enforces the state's Ban the Box law for private employers.
Ban the Box requires employers to consider a job candidate’s skills and experiences before asking about an applicant’s criminal record. The employer must wait until the applicant has been selected for an interview or until a conditional job offer has been extended.
