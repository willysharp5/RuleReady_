Training Requirements
"Legislating excused absences for students attending civic events is a significant milestone in efforts to promote civic education and participation,” **said Dr. Angelica Allen-McMillan, Acting Commissioner of Education.**“By recognizing the educational value of participation in civic events, we are not only providing students with an opportunity to be informed and engaged members of society; we are also sending a clear message that civic responsibilities are valued. This legislation aligns with the vision of nurturing well-rounded, responsible individuals who actively contribute to their communities."
“Certainly our students learn much through classroom instruction, readings and debates with their peers about the workings of government, and may also be made aware of public policy issues important to their communities,” **said Senator Gopal, Chair of the Education Committee**. “Yet there are some things that can only be learned through direct participation and civic engagement. This law will help make that kind of eye-witness learning and development more accessible.”
“Exposing students to civic engagement provides a unique educational experience,” **said Senator Beach**. “By creating opportunities for students to step outside the classroom and witness government in action, we are instilling the values of citizenship at an early age.”
