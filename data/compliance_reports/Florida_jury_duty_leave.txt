Yes. Under federal law, employers must allow their employees time off for jury duty. An employee cannot be punished for serving as a [juror](https://www.flmd.uscourts.gov/jurors). Your employer has discretion whether absence for jury duty is with or without pay.
No. You must request to be excused in writing. A decision will be made as quickly as possible. You may [check on the status of your request](http://apps.flmd.uscourts.gov/appearweb) through the Automated Jury Information System (AJIS) by calling [(866) 313-2350](tel:18663132350) after five to seven business days have passed since you sent the request.

If you are serving on a jury, it is important for you to report when required and be prompt. Absences can delay or even jeopardize trials. If you have an emergency, such as a sudden illness or a death in the family, you should follow the instructions the court gave you. If you cannot do so, you should call the jury staff in the [division](https://www.flmd.uscourts.gov/locations) where your jury service is to take place.
If there is an emergency and someone must contact you during your service, they may call the jury staff in the division where your jury service is to take place, and a message will be delivered to you promptly. Have them specify that you are on jury duty.
You should advise the jury staff in advance so allowances can be made for such matters. Often, the court can arrange to defer jurors to more convenient times; however, you must make such a request before the first day of jury service.

Qualified Trainers
Under the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida's [Plan for the Qualification and Selection of Grand and Petit Jurors](https://www.flmd.uscourts.gov/sites/flmd/files/documents/mdfl-plan-for-the-qualification-and-selection-of-grand-and-petit-jurors-7-8-2019.pdf), voter-registration lists are the primary sources for identifying prospective jurors. Every odd-numbered year, prospective jurors are selected randomly from county voter-registration lists, and their names are put into the divisional Master Jury Wheel. Prospective jurors are then sent a juror-qualification questionnaire, which they must complete and return to the court to verify that they are qualified for jury service. Those who qualify for service might be summoned to report for service.

The Automated Jury Information System (AJIS) enables the court to provide specific, last-minute recorded information relating to the trial on which you have been called to serve. There is no attendant at this number. You will be instructed to call in at a specific time (see your summons) on a specific night, and the message will advise you to report as directed, inform you if there has been a change in the court's schedule, or direct you to call again at another designated date and time.
Do not call AJIS every night you are serving on a trial unless you are specifically instructed by the judge to do so.
If you have questions about either the AJIS telephone or Internet systems, you may [call the jury staff in the division where your jury service is to take place](https://www.flmd.uscourts.gov/faqs/who-contact-person-if-i-have-additional-questions-about-jury-service).
