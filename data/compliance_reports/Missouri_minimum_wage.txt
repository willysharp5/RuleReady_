Missouri Minimum Wage

Overview
Employers engaged in retail or service businesses whose annual gross income is less than $500,000 are not required to pay the state minimum wage rate. Employers not subject to the minimum wage law can pay employees wages of their choosing. For more information, please contact the [United States Department of Labor.](http://www.dol.gov/dol/topic/wages/)
Employers are generally subject to both state minimum wage laws and the federal minimum wage provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), 29 U.S.C. 206, and the FLSA regulations at 29 CFR Part 570. Certain provisions of Missouri state law may be less restrictive than federal law, and employers covered by the FLSA that only follow a less restrictive provision of Missouri state law will be in violation of federal law. _See_ 29 U.S.C.218(a).
