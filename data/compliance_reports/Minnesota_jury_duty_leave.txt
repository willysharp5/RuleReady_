Minnesota Jury Duty Leave

Overview
The statewide jury program is administered by the State Court Administrator’s Office, a Consolidated Jury Unit and the district courts in all 87 counties. Each county has a [jury commissioner](https://mncourts.gov/mncourtsgov/media/scao_library/Jury/Minnesota-Jury-Commissioners.pdf) under Minnesota [General Rule of Practice 803](https://mncourts.gov/mncourtsgov/media/Appellate/Supreme%20Court/Court%20Rules/GRP-Tit-IX.pdf). As authorized and required by [Rule 804](https://mncourts.gov/mncourtsgov/media/Appellate/Supreme%20Court/Court%20Rules/GRP-Tit-IX.pdf), the jury commissioners have adopted the [Minnesota State Jury Administration Plan](https://mncourts.gov/mncourtsgov/media/scao_library/Jury/Minnesota-State-Jury-Admin-Plan.pdf), which describes the state’s jury program procedures.
The idea of a jury of our peers has been fundamental to the American justice system since its beginning. A group of 6 to 12 men and women from all sections of the community sit down together and hear a case of law. These individuals listen to the facts of the case, consult among themselves, and come to a verdict.

Covered Employers
