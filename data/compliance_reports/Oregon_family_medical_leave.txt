Covered Employers
Paid Leave Oregon is a new program that ensures individuals, employers, and families of every kind have the time and support they need to care for themselves and their loved ones when they need it most.
- If you work full time, part time, or for more than one job or employer, it counts.
- Paid leave protects an employee’s job and role if they’ve worked for the same employer for at least 90 consecutive days.

Covered Employees

- Tribal governments aren’t automatically covered and aren’t required to participate but can choose to offer coverage to their employees.
