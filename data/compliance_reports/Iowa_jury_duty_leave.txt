Iowa Jury Duty Leave

Overview
The idea of a jury of our peers has been fundamental to the American justice system since its beginning. A group of six to 12 men and women from all sections of the community sit down together and hear a case brought before the court. These individuals listen to the facts of the case, apply the law provided by the judge, consult among themselves, and come to a verdict.
In each trial, the judge determines the rules of law that govern the case. For example, the judge decides what evidence may be admitted or considers attorneys’ objections to something that was said during trial. At times, the judge may excuse the jury from the courtroom or may speak to the attorneys privately. When this occurs, jurors should not feel that their time is being wasted or that information is being withheld. These conferences allow the trial to continue fairly and efficiently.

Covered Employers
**Civil cases** involve disputes between people or organizations. They may involve property or personal rights, such as landlord/tenant disputes, auto or personal injury accidents, product warranties, contract disputes, and harassment and employment disputes.

If you are summoned for jury service in the Iowa state courts and you request an accommodation for a disability that may affect your ability to serve as a juror, the court will make every attempt to provide you with a reasonable accommodation for your jury service.  When you respond to your juror summons by completing and returning your qualification questionnaire (either online or by mail) to the court, describe your disability and what type of accommodation you are requesting that would enable you to perform jury service. If you are requesting an accommodation to serve, jury staff from the summoning court will contact you prior to your reporting date to confirm the accommodation requested and the arrangements that can be made to enable you to perform jury service.

What Should Employers Do?
In order for our court system to work properly, judges and jurors must consider the cases before them in a way that is thoughtful, involves sound judgment, is impartial and fair, and shows integrity.
At the close of the trial, the judge gives jurors instructions as to the laws that govern the case. At this time, the responsibility switches to the jurors. After listening carefully and considering all of the testimony and evidence, jurors move to the jury room to discuss the case in privacy. Jurors decide which facts in the case are most credible and then apply the law as instructed by the judge in order to reach a verdict.

**Criminal cases** are filed on behalf of citizens by the State of Iowa against individuals or corporations accused of committing crimes. In most cases, a prosecutor files a complaint, which explains the charges against the defendant. If the charge is brought by a grand jury, it is known as an indictment.
Each year, the Iowa Judicial Branch obtains names from a list of licensed drivers, state identification card holders, and registered voters residing in your county and compiles that information into a master jury list. The names of deceased persons, provided by the Department of Health, are removed from the source list. From that list, individuals are randomly selected by computer.

If you received a juror summons and failed to appear, you can be fined, incarcerated, or both.
