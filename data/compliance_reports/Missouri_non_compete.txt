Covered Employers

Many healthcare provider employment and practice agreements contain restrictive covenants, such as noncompetition agreements. Negotiating the terms of a restrictive covenant is advisable, because these agreements can limit future practice options should a healthcare provider subsequently desire to change employers or practice groups, or wish to open their open practice in a nearby area. Noncompetition provisions typically prevent former employees from working for a competitor within a certain distance ( _e.g._, 15 miles) for a set period of time ( _e.g._, three years). [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6390796/#b2-ms116_p0030) Restrictive covenants may also protect confidential information, such as patient lists. Although restrictive covenants are commonly used to protect healthcare employers from the future actions of physician employees, these provisions may also be considered for other types of employees with technical skills and influence over a healthcare employer’s established patient base, such as radiologic technologists and prosthetists. [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6390796/#b3-ms116_p0030)
This article discusses the general legal requirements and enforceability of noncompetition agreements in Missouri. A healthcare provider or employer negotiating the terms of a noncompetition agreement should consult an experienced labor and employment attorney for advice specific to their situation.

[3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6390796/#b3-ms116_p0030)
In noncompetition agreement litigation, courts consider the competing values of employers and employees. The employer needs a highly trained, competitive, and profitable workforce, without fear that workers will take advantage of the employer’s business secrets and any specialized training, or steal the employer’s customers. Likewise, employees need the ability to advance their careers and provide for their families, both of which may at times require seeking different employment. [4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6390796/#b4-ms116_p0030) In these cases, courts also consider two long held rules of law: the freedom to contract and the rule against restraint of trade. [5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6390796/#b5-ms116_p0030) On the one hand, parties are allowed to negotiate away some of their rights, such as the right to work within a certain distance of former employers, in exchange for employment and other benefits. But employers are not allowed to overly restrict future employment opportunities. Therefore, Missouri courts uphold reasonable noncompetition agreements in some, but not all, circumstances. [6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6390796/#b6-ms116_p0030)
First, valid noncompetition agreements must be supported by consideration, meaning the employer must give something of value in exchange for the employee’s promise not to compete. [9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6390796/#b9-ms116_p0030) Typically, a noncompetition is signed as part of the initial employment contract, before the new employee begins work. However, if the agreement is signed after employment begins, continuing employment can still qualify as consideration in an at-will employment contract, provided the employee also has ongoing access to the protected assets and relationships of the employer ( _e.g._, the employee has regular contacts with patients, access to customer lists, and/or specialized trainings). [10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6390796/#b10-ms116_p0030) Other benefits, such as a separate payment or promotion, are also sufficient consideration, whether the noncompetition agreement is signed before or after employment begins.

What Should Employers Do?
This article discusses the general legal requirements and enforceability of noncompetition agreements in Missouri.

[6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6390796/#b6-ms116_p0030)
The most frequently litigated issue about noncompetition agreements is whether or not the provision is valid. [7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6390796/#b7-ms116_p0030) To be valid, a noncompetition agreement must meet the following criteria: 1. it must be supported by consideration; 2. it must serve legitimate interests of the employer; and 3. it must be reasonable in scope, time, and distance. [8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6390796/#b8-ms116_p0030)

Training Requirements
In noncompetition agreement litigation, courts consider the competing values of employers and employees. The employer needs a highly trained, competitive, and profitable workforce, without fear that workers will take advantage of the employer’s business secrets and any specialized training, or steal the employer’s customers. Likewise, employees need the ability to advance their careers and provide for their families, both of which may at times require seeking different employment.

[11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6390796/#b11-ms116_p0030)
Second, the noncompetition agreement must exist to protect a legitimate business interest. In Missouri, legitimate interests include confidential information and customer relationships, including a healthcare provider’s established patient base. [12](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6390796/#b12-ms116_p0030) The classic type of confidential information is an employer’s trade secrets, which are actually protected even without a specific noncompetition agreement. However, confidential information may also include specialized training techniques and customer or patient contacts or lists, when the purpose of the noncompetition provision is to keep the former employee from using this type of information against the former employer. [13](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6390796/#b13-ms116_p0030) Further, the employee must have sufficient contact with, and influence over, customers or in the case of physicians, their patients to lure them from the former employer.

[6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6390796/#b6-ms116_p0030)
Finally, the noncompetition agreement must be reasonable in scope, time, and distance. To determine reasonableness, Missouri courts look at whether the agreement is more restrictive than necessary to protect the employer’s legitimate interests. [15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6390796/#b15-ms116_p0030) A noncompetition agreement is always deemed too restrictive if it seeks to protect the employer from “mere” competition because all employers are subject to some competition, even from former employees. [16](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6390796/#b16-ms116_p0030) For example, a noncompetition agreement preventing a former employee from looking for _new_ customers is too restrictive. [17](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6390796/#b17-ms116_p0030) Courts also examine whether time and distance restrictions are fair. For example, in the context of a physician noncompetition agreement, Missouri Courts have upheld a provision restricting a physician from practicing within a 75-mile radius of their former employer for a period of two-years. [18](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6390796/#b18-ms116_p0030) A noncompetition agreement lacking any geographic limit ( _i.e._, a global noncompete) is unenforceable; an agreement with an unreasonable number of years ( _e.g._, former employee cannot compete for decades) would also likely be unenforceable.
