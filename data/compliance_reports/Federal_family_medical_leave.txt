Federal Paid Family / Medical Leave (PFML)

Overview
This guidance will impact the District of Columbia and states administering paid family and medical leave programs, employers and workers contributing to such programs, and those who receive payments from these programs.

Covered Employers
WASHINGTON — The Internal Revenue Service today issued guidance on the income and employment tax treatment of contributions and benefits paid in certain situations under a state paid family and medical leave program, as well as the related reporting requirements. [Rev. Rul. 2025-4](https://www.irs.gov/irb/2025-07_IRB#REV-RUL-2025-4) provides guidance to the District of Columbia and states that have mandatory paid family and medical leave programs and for employees working in and employers operating in those states. Today’s guidance responds to requests to clarify the federal tax treatment of state paid leave programs that help pay employees who can’t work because of non-occupational injuries to themselves or family members, as well as sickness and disabilities.
For example, in general, employers can deduct the amount they contribute to mandatory paid family and medical leave programs as a payment of excise tax. Similarly, an employee may deduct the amount they contribute as a payment of income tax, if the employee itemizes deductions, to the extent that the employee’s deduction for state income taxes does not exceed the state income tax deduction limitation.
An employee who receives state paid family leave payments must include those amounts in the employee’s gross income. An employee who receives state paid medical leave payments must include the amount attributable to the employer portion of contributions in the employee’s gross income. This latter amount also is subject both to the employer’s and employee’s shares of Social Security and Medicare taxes. The amount attributable to the employee’s portion of the contributions is excluded from the employee’s gross income, and this amount is not subject to Social Security or Medicare taxes.
