Arkansas Workplace Safety Requirements (OSHA or state-level)

Overview
Arkansas Occupational Safety and Health is responsible for administering Arkansas’ laws dealing with safety and health. Because most private sector employees and employers are covered by the rules of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), this section primarily deals with public sector employment. The inspectors investigate complaints, accidents and fatalities in public sector workplaces and check for violations of Arkansas safety and health rules. Employees of the public sector can call in complaints to the AOSH Compliance Section and an inspector may visit the worksite. They are also responsible for enforcing the Public Employees’ Chemical Right to Know Act and the rules issued pursuant to the act.
This form must be completed by any person, firm, or corporation that desires to carry on any work of activity within ten feet (10′) of overhead energized electrical lines or conductors. Ark. Code Ann 11-5-307. The ten feet clearance applies to any part of any machinery, equipment or materials, as well as any employee or person.
