No. As an employer, you are required to make the posters available to your employees where they can see and read them. (See below for posting requirements.) Employers may provide electronic links to the poster information in addition to posting the actual posters in the workplace. For example, if your business has an internal web page, you could include a link to the workplace posters as an additional resource.

Recordkeeping Requirements
[L&I’s Job Safety and Health Law poster](https://lni.wa.gov/forms-publications/search?query=F416-081-909) (F416-081-909) takes place of the federal OSHA Workplace Poster. For all others, employers must post both state and federal posters.

Send each employee a set of posters. You can order them at no cost by visiting [Lni.wa.gov/Posters](https://Lni.wa.gov/Posters). You may want to document that you sent the posters to your employees.
Send each employee an email with a link to [Lni.wa.gov/Posters](https://Lni.wa.gov/Posters). Instruct your employees to read the posters and print them for their records. They do not have to post them in their home or vehicle.

Penalties for Non-Compliance
The key consideration is where the employees report for work. If your employees report to a central office, posting in the office is fine. If they report to a job shack, post them there. You may want to do both as the posters are free. You are not required to post them in a truck.
