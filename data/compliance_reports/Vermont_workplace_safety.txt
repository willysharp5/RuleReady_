Covered Employers
Since 1974, Vermont’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (VOSHA) has labored diligently to protect the health and safety of working Vermonters. A safe and Helpful workplace is important to the financial wellbeing of an establishment. Employees are more productive and happier when employers have taken the steps necessary to reduce the risk of injury or illness. A first line of defense against rising Workers’ Compensations costs is to reduce or eliminate the injuries in your workplace. VOSHA wants to work with employers and employees to reduce workplace injuries and illnesses through education and enforcement activities.
