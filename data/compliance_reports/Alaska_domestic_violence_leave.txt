Recordkeeping Requirements
Domestic Violence is when one person maintains control and power over another in a dating, marital, or live-in relationship. The means of control include physical, sexual, emotional and economical abuse, threats and isolation. While most domestic violence survivors are women, both men and women can experience domestic violence. You probably have found your ability to make decisions being taken away by the abuser. With your choices and options removed, the abuser may come to treat you like a piece of property he owns, rather than as an equal in making decisions regarding your household, children, or other matters.
- Keep a packed bag with emergency items including birth certificates, social security cards, other important papers, extra sets of car and house keys, and money
