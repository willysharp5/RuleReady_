Missouri Background Check / Ban-the-Box

Overview
What you **should NOT** ask: What religion do you practice?
Employers may not inquire directly about an applicant’s religious beliefs or practices. However, it is appropriate to inquire into when the applicant is able to work because the employer will need to know if the applicant can work the employer’s schedule. Employers should be cautious because there is a duty to provide a reasonable accommodation for religious beliefs of its employees or applicants.

The following information provides guidance for job seekers and employers about acceptable and unacceptable questions to ask on a job application or during a job interview. Inappropriate pre-employment inquiries may be used as evidence of [Employment Discrimination](https://labor.mo.gov/mohumanrights/discrimination/employment).
Directly inquiring into an applicant’s residency in the country or region is not appropriate even though familiarity with the local culture may be important to the job. Employers are not prohibited from asking about place of residence but if applicants are excluded from employment because they live in an area that primarily consists of individuals of a particular racial or ethnic group then it may lead to future discrimination claims.

What Should Employers Do?
What you **may** ask: Are you able to work with our required schedule?
Questions regarding number of children and childcare arrangements should not be asked unless they are job-related and then must be asked of all applicants. Employers can inquire about the applicant’s availability for work.
An employer is prohibited from asking an applicant about the existence, nature, or severity of a disability. However, an employer may ask questions about the applicant’s ability to perform job-related functions or request a demonstration of the applicant’s ability to perform job-related functions. These questions must be asked of all applicants.
The Missouri Human Rights Act (MHRA) prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities. The MHRA requires employers to make reasonable accommodations for the disabilities of applicants or employees if it does not impose an undue hardship.

Coverage Election
Making pre-employment inquiries that directly or indirectly disclose the applicant’s race, color, religion, sex, national origin, ancestry or age do not constitute a **per se** violation of the MHRA. However, unless needed for some legal purpose, such as obtaining applicant flow data for affirmative action plans, such inquiries may be important evidence of discriminatory selection. Employers should NOT inquire about matters which may disproportionately **exclude members of protected groups**, unless the employer can show that the inquiry is job-related and consistent with business necessity.

Recordkeeping Requirements
Employers are prohibited from making employment decisions based on the applicant’s age. Therefore inquiring into an applicant's age or retirement plans may lead to discrimination complaints being filed. Asking questions about age may indicate possible intent to discriminate based on age or deter older workers from applying for employment. It is advisable just to make sure that the individual is legally old enough and to find out what the applicant’s career plans are. Inquiries into an applicant’s age are permissible if age is a bona fide occupational qualification.
If you feel you’ve been discriminated after reading these guidelines, you can [file a discrimination complaint](https://labor.mo.gov/mohumanrights/file-complaint).
