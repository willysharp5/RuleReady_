Employer Responsibilities & Deadlines
Example 1: Employer establishes a weekly pay period. The workweek is from Sunday January 1 through Saturday January 7. Unless a different payment interval applies by law, the employer must pay wages no later than January 17.
Example 2: Employer establishes two semi-monthly pay periods (the first pay period covers the 1st day of the month to the 15th day of the month; the second pay period covers the 16th day of the month to the last day of the month). Unless a different payment interval applies by law, the employer must pay wages no later than the 25th day of the current month for the first pay period, and no later than the 10th day of the following month for the second pay period.
Example: Employer establishes a monthly pay period starting on the 1st day of each month with an established pay day on the last day of the month. In a thirty-one-day month, unless a different payment interval applies by law, the employer must pay wages for work performed between the 1st and 24th days of the month on the established pay day (the last day of the month). The employer may pay wages for work performed between the 25th and 31st days of the current month on the following month's pay day (which means that the employer would pay wages for work performed between the 25th and 31st days of the current month, and the 1st and 24th days of the following month, on the following month's pay day).
