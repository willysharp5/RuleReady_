California Day-of-Rest / Predetermined Break Laws

Overview
## Rest Periods/Lactation Accommodation
In California, the [Industrial Welfare Commission Wage Orders](https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/Glossary.asp?Button1=I#Industrial%20Welfare%20Commission%20Wage%20Orders) require that employers must authorize and permit nonexempt employees to take a rest period that must, insofar as practicable, be taken in the middle of each work period. The rest period is based on the total hours worked daily and must be at the minimum rate of a net ten consecutive minutes for each four hour work period, or major fraction thereof. The Division of Labor Standards Enforcement (DLSE) considers anything more than two hours to be a "major fraction" of four." A rest period is not required for employees whose total daily work time is less than three and one-half hours. The rest period is counted as time worked and therefore, the employer must pay for such periods. With respect to the taking of rest periods, an exception exists under [IWC Order 5-2001, Section 12(C)](https://www.dir.ca.gov/IWC/IWCArticle5.pdf) for certain employees of 24-hour residential care facilities who may have their rest period limited under certain circumstances. Another exception to the general rest period requirement is for swimmers, dancers, skaters, and other performers engaged in strenuous physical activities who shall have additional interim rest periods during periods of actual rehearsal or shooting. [IWC Order 12-2001, Section 12 (C)](https://www.dir.ca.gov/IWC/IWCArticle12.pdf).

For employees in certain on-site occupations in the construction, drilling, logging and mining industries, the employer may stagger the rest periods to avoid interruption in the flow of work and to maintain continuous operations, or schedule rest periods to coincide with breaks in the flow of work that occur in the course of the workday. [IWC Order 16-2001, Section 11(A)](https://www.dir.ca.gov/IWC/IWCArticle16.pdf) Additionally, for these employees rest periods need not be authorized in limited circumstances when the disruption of continuous operations would jeopardize the product or process of the work. However, under such circumstances, the employer must make-up the missed rest period within the same workday or compensate the employee for the missed ten minutes of rest time at his or her [regular rate of pay](https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/Glossary.asp?Button1=R#regular%20rate%20of%20pay) within the same pay period. [IWC Order 16-2001, Section 11(B)](https://www.dir.ca.gov/IWC/IWCArticle16.pdf) Under [Order 16-2001](https://www.dir.ca.gov/IWC/IWCArticle16.pdf), rest periods must take place at employer designated areas which may include or be limited to the employees immediate work area. See Question No. 9, below, for information on how to file a claim to require your employer to provide time and a place to express milk.
Pursuant to [Labor Code Section 1030](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=LAB&sectionNum=1030.) every employer, including the state and any political subdivision, must provide a reasonable amount of break time to accommodate an employee desiring to express breast milk for the employee's infant child each time the employee has a need to express milk. The break time shall, if possible, run concurrently with any break time already provided to the employee.Break time for an employee that does not run concurrently with the rest time authorized for the employee by the applicable wage order of the Industrial Welfare Commission need not be paid.Pursuant to [Labor Code Section 1033](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=1033.&nodeTreePath=3.3.9&lawCode=LAB), the denial of a break or adequate space to express milk may result in the recovery of one hour of pay at the employee’s [regular rate of pay](https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/Glossary.asp?Button1=R#regular%20rate%20of%20pay) for _each violation_ by filing a wage claim under Labor Code section 226.7. Additionally, an employee may report a violation of the lactation accommodations laws with the Labor Commissioner’s Bureau of Field Enforcement (BOFE), and after an inspection or investigation, BOFE may issue a citation for one hundred dollars ($100) for _each day_ an employee is denied reasonable break time or adequate space to express milk.

| | **A.** | No, the 10-minute rest period is not designed to be exclusively for use of toilet facilities as evidenced by the fact that the Industrial Welfare Commission requires suitable resting facilities be in an area "separate from toilet rooms." The intent of the Industrial Welfare Commission regarding rest periods is clear: the rest period is not to be confused with or limited to breaks taken by employees to use toilet facilities. This conclusion is required by a reading of the provisions of IWC Orders, Section 12, Rest Periods, in conjunction with the provisions of Section 13(B), Change Rooms And Resting Facilities, which requires that "Suitable resting facilities shall be provided in an area separate from the toilet rooms and shall be available to employees during work hours." Allowing employees to use toilet facilities during working hours does not meet the employer's obligation to provide rest periods as required by the IWC Orders. This is not to say, of course, that employers do not have the right to reasonably limit the amount of time an employee may be absent from his or her work station; and, it does not indicate that an employee who chooses to use the toilet facilities while on an authorized break may extend the break time by doing so. DLSE policy simply prohibits an employer from requiring that employees count any separate use of toilet facilities as a rest period. |

| | **A.** | In the case of Murphy v. Cole, the California Supreme Court held that the remedy for meal and rest period violations of "one additional hour of pay" under Labor Code section 226.7 is a wage subject to a three-year statute of limitations. Accordingly, a claim must be filed within three (3) years of the alleged rest period violation.

Special Requirements
In California, the [Industrial Welfare Commission Wage Orders](https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/Glossary.asp?Button1=I#Industrial%20Welfare%20Commission%20Wage%20Orders) require that employers must authorize and permit nonexempt employees to take a rest period that must, insofar as practicable, be taken in the middle of each work period. The rest period is based on the total hours worked daily and must be at the minimum rate of a net ten consecutive minutes for each four hour work period, or major fraction thereof. The Division of Labor Standards Enforcement (DLSE) considers anything more than two hours to be a "major fraction" of four." A rest period is not required for employees whose total daily work time is less than three and one-half hours. The rest period is counted as time worked and therefore, the employer must pay for such periods. With respect to the taking of rest periods, an exception exists under [IWC Order 5-2001, Section 12(C)](https://www.dir.ca.gov/IWC/IWCArticle5.pdf) for certain employees of 24-hour residential care facilities who may have their rest period limited under certain circumstances. Another exception to the general rest period requirement is for swimmers, dancers, skaters, and other performers engaged in strenuous physical activities who shall have additional interim rest periods during periods of actual rehearsal or shooting.

Reciprocity/Extraterritorial Coverage
Pursuant to [Labor Code Section 1030](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=LAB&sectionNum=1030.) every employer, including the state and any political subdivision, must provide a reasonable amount of break time to accommodate an employee desiring to express breast milk for the employee's infant child each time the employee has a need to express milk.

| | **A.** | After your claim is completed and filed with a local office of the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement (DLSE), it will be assigned to a Deputy Labor Commissioner who will determine, based upon the circumstances of the claim and information presented, how best to proceed. Initial action taken regarding the claim can be referral to a conference or hearing, or dismissal of the claim. If the decision is to hold a conference, the parties will be notified by mail of the date, time and place of the conference. The purpose of the conference is to determine the validity of the claim, and to see if the claim can be resolved without a hearing. If the claim is not resolved at the conference, the next step usually is to refer the matter to a hearing or dismiss it for lack of evidence. At the hearing the parties and witnesses testify under oath, and the proceeding is recorded. After the hearing, an Order, Decision, or Award (ODA) of the Labor Commissioner will be served on the parties. Either party may appeal the ODA to a civil court of competent jurisdiction. The court will set the matter for trial, with each party having the opportunity to present evidence and witnesses. The evidence and testimony presented at the Labor Commissioner's hearing will not be the basis for the court's decision. In the case of an appeal by the employer, DLSE may represent an employee who is financially unable to afford counsel in the court proceeding. See the [Policies and Procedures of Wage Claim Processing](https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/Policies.htm) pamphlet for more detail on the wage claim procedure. |

Employer Responsibilities & Deadlines
In California, the [Industrial Welfare Commission Wage Orders](https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/Glossary.asp?Button1=I#Industrial%20Welfare%20Commission%20Wage%20Orders) require that employers must authorize and permit nonexempt employees to take a rest period that must, insofar as practicable, be taken in the middle of each work period. The rest period is based on the total hours worked daily and must be at the minimum rate of a net ten consecutive minutes for each four hour work period, or major fraction thereof. The Division of Labor Standards Enforcement (DLSE) considers anything more than two hours to be a "major fraction" of four." A rest period is not required for employees whose total daily work time is less than three and one-half hours. The rest period is counted as time worked and therefore, the employer must pay for such periods. With respect to the taking of rest periods, an exception exists under [IWC Order 5-2001, Section 12(C)](https://www.dir.ca.gov/IWC/IWCArticle5.pdf) for certain employees of 24-hour residential care facilities who may have their rest period limited under certain circumstances. Another exception to the general rest period requirement is for swimmers, dancers, skaters, and other performers engaged in strenuous physical activities who shall have additional interim rest periods during periods of actual rehearsal or shooting. [IWC Order 12-2001, Section 12 (C)](https://www.dir.ca.gov/IWC/IWCArticle12.pdf).
For employees in certain on-site occupations in the construction, drilling, logging and mining industries, the employer may stagger the rest periods to avoid interruption in the flow of work and to maintain continuous operations, or schedule rest periods to coincide with breaks in the flow of work that occur in the course of the workday. [IWC Order 16-2001, Section 11(A)](https://www.dir.ca.gov/IWC/IWCArticle16.pdf) Additionally, for these employees rest periods need not be authorized in limited circumstances when the disruption of continuous operations would jeopardize the product or process of the work. However, under such circumstances, the employer must make-up the missed rest period within the same workday or compensate the employee for the missed ten minutes of rest time at his or her [regular rate of pay](https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/Glossary.asp?Button1=R#regular%20rate%20of%20pay) within the same pay period. [IWC Order 16-2001, Section 11(B)](https://www.dir.ca.gov/IWC/IWCArticle16.pdf) Under [Order 16-2001](https://www.dir.ca.gov/IWC/IWCArticle16.pdf), rest periods must take place at employer designated areas which may include or be limited to the employees immediate work area. See Question No. 9, below, for information on how to file a claim to require your employer to provide time and a place to express milk.

The break time shall, if possible, run concurrently with any break time already provided to the employee.Break time for an employee that does not run concurrently with the rest time authorized for the employee by the applicable wage order of the Industrial Welfare Commission need not be paid.Pursuant to [Labor Code Section 1033](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=1033.&nodeTreePath=3.3.9&lawCode=LAB), the denial of a break or adequate space to express milk may result in the recovery of one hour of pay at the employee’s [regular rate of pay](https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/Glossary.asp?Button1=R#regular%20rate%20of%20pay) for _each violation_ by filing a wage claim under Labor Code section 226.7. Additionally, an employee may report a violation of the lactation accommodations laws with the Labor Commissioner’s Bureau of Field Enforcement (BOFE), and after an inspection or investigation, BOFE may issue a citation for one hundred dollars ($100) for _each day_ an employee is denied reasonable break time or adequate space to express milk.

Employer Notification Requirements
For employees in certain on-site occupations in the construction, drilling, logging and mining industries, the employer may stagger the rest periods to avoid interruption in the flow of work and to maintain continuous operations, or schedule rest periods to coincide with breaks in the flow of work that occur in the course of the workday. [IWC Order 16-2001, Section 11(A)](https://www.dir.ca.gov/IWC/IWCArticle16.pdf) Additionally, for these employees rest periods need not be authorized in limited circumstances when the disruption of continuous operations would jeopardize the product or process of the work. However, under such circumstances, the employer must make-up the missed rest period within the same workday or compensate the employee for the missed ten minutes of rest time at his or her [regular rate of pay](https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/Glossary.asp?Button1=R#regular%20rate%20of%20pay) within the same pay period. [IWC Order 16-2001, Section 11(B)](https://www.dir.ca.gov/IWC/IWCArticle16.pdf) Under [Order 16-2001](https://www.dir.ca.gov/IWC/IWCArticle16.pdf), rest periods must take place at employer designated areas which may include or be limited to the employees immediate work area. See Question No. 9, below, for information on how to file a claim to require your employer to provide time and a place to express milk.
| | **A.** | After your claim is completed and filed with a local office of the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement (DLSE), it will be assigned to a Deputy Labor Commissioner who will determine, based upon the circumstances of the claim and information presented, how best to proceed. Initial action taken regarding the claim can be referral to a conference or hearing, or dismissal of the claim. If the decision is to hold a conference, the parties will be notified by mail of the date, time and place of the conference. The purpose of the conference is to determine the validity of the claim, and to see if the claim can be resolved without a hearing. If the claim is not resolved at the conference, the next step usually is to refer the matter to a hearing or dismiss it for lack of evidence. At the hearing the parties and witnesses testify under oath, and the proceeding is recorded. After the hearing, an Order, Decision, or Award (ODA) of the Labor Commissioner will be served on the parties. Either party may appeal the ODA to a civil court of competent jurisdiction. The court will set the matter for trial, with each party having the opportunity to present evidence and witnesses. The evidence and testimony presented at the Labor Commissioner's hearing will not be the basis for the court's decision. In the case of an appeal by the employer, DLSE may represent an employee who is financially unable to afford counsel in the court proceeding. See the [Policies and Procedures of Wage Claim Processing](https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/Policies.htm) pamphlet for more detail on the wage claim procedure. |

Posting Requirements
Pursuant to [Labor Code Section 1030](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=LAB&sectionNum=1030.) every employer, including the state and any political subdivision, must provide a reasonable amount of break time to accommodate an employee desiring to express breast milk for the employee's infant child each time the employee has a need to express milk. The break time shall, if possible, run concurrently with any break time already provided to the employee.Break time for an employee that does not run concurrently with the rest time authorized for the employee by the applicable wage order of the Industrial Welfare Commission need not be paid.Pursuant to [Labor Code Section 1033](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=1033.&nodeTreePath=3.3.9&lawCode=LAB), the denial of a break or adequate space to express milk may result in the recovery of one hour of pay at the employee’s [regular rate of pay](https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/Glossary.asp?Button1=R#regular%20rate%20of%20pay) for _each violation_ by filing a wage claim under Labor Code section 226.7. Additionally, an employee may report a violation of the lactation accommodations laws with the Labor Commissioner’s Bureau of Field Enforcement (BOFE), and after an inspection or investigation, BOFE may issue a citation for one hundred dollars ($100) for _each day_ an employee is denied reasonable break time or adequate space to express milk.
If an employer fails to provide an employee a rest period in accordance with an applicable [IWC Order](https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/Glossary.asp?Button1=I#IWC%20Order), the employer shall pay the employee one additional hour of pay at the employee's [regular rate of pay](https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/Glossary.asp?Button1=R#regular%20rate%20of%20pay) for each workday that the rest period is not provided. [Labor Code Section 226.7](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=LAB&sectionNum=226.7.) Thus, if an employer does not provide all of the rest periods required in a workday, the employee is entitled to one additional hour of pay for that workday, not one additional hour of pay for each rest period that was not provided during that workday.
| | **A.** | No, your employer cannot impose any restraints not inherent in the rest period requirement itself. In Augustus v. ABM Security Services, Inc., (2016) 5 Cal.5th 257, 269, the California Supreme Court held that the rest period requirement "obligates employers to permit-and authorizes employees to take-off-duty rest periods. That is, during rest periods employers must relieve employees of all duties and relinquish control over how employees spend their time." (citation omitted) As a practical matter, however, if an employee is provided a ten minute rest period, the employee can only travel five minutes from a work post before heading back to return in time. |

Recordkeeping Requirements
For employees in certain on-site occupations in the construction, drilling, logging and mining industries, the employer may stagger the rest periods to avoid interruption in the flow of work and to maintain continuous operations, or schedule rest periods to coincide with breaks in the flow of work that occur in the course of the workday. [IWC Order 16-2001, Section 11(A)](https://www.dir.ca.gov/IWC/IWCArticle16.pdf) Additionally, for these employees rest periods need not be authorized in limited circumstances when the disruption of continuous operations would jeopardize the product or process of the work.

[IWC Order 16-2001, Section 11(B)](https://www.dir.ca.gov/IWC/IWCArticle16.pdf) Under [Order 16-2001](https://www.dir.ca.gov/IWC/IWCArticle16.pdf), rest periods must take place at employer designated areas which may include or be limited to the employees immediate work area. See Question No. 9, below, for information on how to file a claim to require your employer to provide time and a place to express milk.
| | **A.** | Yes, there is something you can do if you are an employee covered by the rest period requirements of the [Industrial Welfare Commission Wage Orders](https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/Glossary.asp?Button1=I#Industrial%20Welfare%20Commission%20Wage%20Orders). If your employer fails to authorize and permit the required rest period(s), you are to be paid one hour of pay at your regular rate of compensation for each workday that the rest period is not authorized or permitted. If your employer fails to pay the additional one-hour's pay, you may [file a wage claim](https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/HowToFileWageClaim.htm) with the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement. |
| **6.** | **Q.** | **Can an employer require that you keep in radio communication on a rest period?** |

Penalties for Non-Compliance
Pursuant to [Labor Code Section 1030](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=LAB&sectionNum=1030.) every employer, including the state and any political subdivision, must provide a reasonable amount of break time to accommodate an employee desiring to express breast milk for the employee's infant child each time the employee has a need to express milk. The break time shall, if possible, run concurrently with any break time already provided to the employee.Break time for an employee that does not run concurrently with the rest time authorized for the employee by the applicable wage order of the Industrial Welfare Commission need not be paid.Pursuant to [Labor Code Section 1033](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=1033.&nodeTreePath=3.3.9&lawCode=LAB), the denial of a break or adequate space to express milk may result in the recovery of one hour of pay at the employee’s [regular rate of pay](https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/Glossary.asp?Button1=R#regular%20rate%20of%20pay) for _each violation_ by filing a wage claim under Labor Code section 226.7. Additionally, an employee may report a violation of the lactation accommodations laws with the Labor Commissioner’s Bureau of Field Enforcement (BOFE), and after an inspection or investigation, BOFE may issue a citation for one hundred dollars ($100) for _each day_ an employee is denied reasonable break time or adequate space to express milk.
The rest period is defined as a "net" ten minutes, which means that the rest period begins when the employee reaches an area away from the work area that is appropriate for rest. Employers are required to provide suitable resting facilities that shall be available for employees during working hours in an area separate from the toilet rooms.
| | **A.** | If you feel your employer is not providing you with adequate break time and/or a place to express milk as provided for in Labor Code section 1030, you may file a wage claim under Labor Code section 226.7 and recover one hour of pay for each violation. See [https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/HowToFileWageClaim.htm](https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/HowToFileWageClaim.htm).  You may also file a report/claim with the DLSE Bureau of Field Enforcement (BOFE) at the BOFE office nearest your place of employment.  See [http://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/HowToReportViolationtoBOFE.htm](https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/HowToReportViolationtoBOFE.htm). The DLSE may, after an inspection, issue to an employer who violates any provision of this chapter, a civil citation ($100.00 for each day an employee is denied reasonable break time or adequate space to express milk) that may be contested in accordance with the procedure outlined in [Labor Code Section 1197.1](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=LAB&sectionNum=1197.1.) ( [Labor Code Section 1033](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=LAB&sectionNum=1033.)). In addition, any employee who is a victim of retaliation for either asserting or attempting to assert a right to lactation accommodation or for complaining to the DLSE about the failure of an employer to provide this accommodation may file a retaliation claim with DLSE pursuant to [Labor Code Section 98.7](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=LAB&sectionNum=98.7.). See [https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/HowToFileRetaliationComplaint.htm](https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/HowToFileRetaliationComplaint.htm).. |
| | **A.** | In the case of Murphy v. Cole, the California Supreme Court held that the remedy for meal and rest period violations of "one additional hour of pay" under Labor Code section 226.7 is a wage subject to a three-year statute of limitations. Accordingly, a claim must be filed within three (3) years of the alleged rest period violation. See attached Division [memoranda](https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/rrr%20march%207,%202008%20memo%20to%20dlse%20staff%20re%20meal%20and%20rest%20period%20statute%20of%20limitations.pdf) regarding the Court's decision. |
