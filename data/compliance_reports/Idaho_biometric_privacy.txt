Idaho Biometric Privacy / AI Use Laws (emerging)

Overview
The Idaho Artificial Intelligence Working Group met on December 17th, 2024 for the second time since Its formation. With the new year underway, s tate government employees will continue to experiment with and use generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) in various ways. This marks a significant step for Idaho but also reveals some challenges in terms of adoption, regulatory concerns, and employee readiness. The survey, which included 2,802 responses from employees across 45 state agencies, provides a snapshot of AI’s current use and perceptions in Idaho’s state government. While 65% of employees are aware of generative AI, only 23% reported that their agencies are currently using it. Around 51% of respondents indicated their agencies aren’t using AI yet, while 23% are still exploring its potential applications. These results suggested that, while interest in AI is high, actual implementation has been slow. Many agencies are taking a cautious approach, with concerns over data privacy, ethical implications, and AI's impact on jobs, and rightfully so. The survey highlighted a notable balance of enthusiasm and skepticism about AI’s role in government work. Despite the concerns, the survey results reflect a growing recognition of AI's potential. Many employees have seen AI improve efficiency, enhance service delivery, and support decision-making processes. For example, AI has already been deployed for tasks like automating document generation, analyzing images and videos, and providing customer service through chatbots. These applications are helping Idaho state agencies reduce manual work, save time, and increase overall productivity. Looking ahead, there is significant interest in expanding AI's use across different functions within the state government. Employees have expressed interest in leveraging AI to automate additional processes, improve content creation, and enhance data analysis capabilities. This is seen as an opportunity to streamline operations and address staff shortages by reducing the need for new full-time employees. While the potential benefits of AI are clear, the survey also uncovered widespread concern over the risks associated with its use. Data privacy emerged as the top issue, with employees fearing that sensitive data could be exposed if used improperly in AI systems. There is also an awareness of AI's societal and environmental impacts, raising questions about fairness, bias, and job displacement. One respondent noted, "The more you leverage technology and AI, the greater the efficiencies, but it will also result in fewer full-time employee (FTE) requests or even potential job cuts in the future." There is a strong call for legal and ethical guidance to help agencies navigate these risks. Many employees seek clearer frameworks around AI usage, including regulations on data governance, training, and oversight. The uncertainty surrounding the ethical implications of AI use is one of the main barriers to faster adoption. The Idaho Legislature’s AI Working Group met twice in 2024 and is attempting to address these concerns head-on. The group, comprised of state lawmakers and key stakeholders, is focused on studying AI’s potential role in Idaho’s governance and identifying areas for potential legislation. The committee plans to continue gathering feedback and providing legal and ethical guidelines to ensure that AI is used responsibly. This includes addressing key areas like data governance, training, and collaboration across state agencies. With AI still in its early stages of adoption, Idaho aims to pilot key initiatives in select agencies and track the outcomes before scaling the technology statewide. To maximize the potential of AI in Idaho’s state government, agencies should prioritize its integration into administrative and routine tasks that currently consume significant employee time. AI has proven to be highly effective in automating document generation, data entry, and other repetitive functions that do not require complex decision-making. By leveraging AI for these tasks, agencies can free up valuable time for employees to focus on more critical, strategic work. For instance, AI can be used to automate reports, schedule meetings, and process forms. These tasks are often tedious and time-consuming but necessary for the smooth operation of government functions. To ensure quality and accountability, AI-generated work should be reviewed by a manager or designated employee before final approval. This approach allows agencies to capitalize on the efficiency of AI while maintaining oversight and ensuring that work meets the necessary standards. By adopting AI for these routine functions, Idaho’s state agencies can significantly reduce administrative burdens, increase overall productivity, and redirect human resources toward more complex and impactful work. As AI technology continues to evolve, expanding its use across administrative tasks will be an essential step in modernizing government operations and ensuring that state employees can perform at their highest potential. While AI promises significant benefits in terms of efficiency and productivity, it is equally important to ensure that it is used securely and protects user data. The 2025 Legislative Session will likely be pivotal in shaping the direction of AI’s role in Idaho’s government, balancing the excitement for innovation with the need for proper guidance and safeguards. As Gonzalez highlighted, the future of AI in Idaho may involve major efficiencies, but only with careful planning and human oversight.

There is also an awareness of AI's societal and environmental impacts, raising questions about fairness, bias, and job displacement. One respondent noted, "The more you leverage technology and AI, the greater the efficiencies, but it will also result in fewer full-time employee (FTE) requests or even potential job cuts in the future." There is a strong call for legal and ethical guidance to help agencies navigate these risks. Many employees seek clearer frameworks around AI usage, including regulations on data governance, training, and oversight. The uncertainty surrounding the ethical implications of AI use is one of the main barriers to faster adoption. The Idaho Legislature’s AI Working Group met twice in 2024 and is attempting to address these concerns head-on. The group, comprised of state lawmakers and key stakeholders, is focused on studying AI’s potential role in Idaho’s governance and identifying areas for potential legislation. The committee plans to continue gathering feedback and providing legal and ethical guidelines to ensure that AI is used responsibly. This includes addressing key areas like data governance, training, and collaboration across state agencies. With AI still in its early stages of adoption, Idaho aims to pilot key initiatives in select agencies and track the outcomes before scaling the technology statewide. To maximize the potential of AI in Idaho’s state government, agencies should prioritize its integration into administrative and routine tasks that currently consume significant employee time. AI has proven to be highly effective in automating document generation, data entry, and other repetitive functions that do not require complex decision-making. By leveraging AI for these tasks, agencies can free up valuable time for employees to focus on more critical, strategic work. For instance, AI can be used to automate reports, schedule meetings, and process forms. These tasks are often tedious and time-consuming but necessary for the smooth operation of government functions. To ensure quality and accountability, AI-generated work should be reviewed by a manager or designated employee before final approval. This approach allows agencies to capitalize on the efficiency of AI while maintaining oversight and ensuring that work meets the necessary standards. By adopting AI for these routine functions, Idaho’s state agencies can significantly reduce administrative burdens, increase overall productivity, and redirect human resources toward more complex and impactful work. As AI technology continues to evolve, expanding its use across administrative tasks will be an essential step in modernizing government operations and ensuring that state employees can perform at their highest potential. While AI promises significant benefits in terms of efficiency and productivity, it is equally important to ensure that it is used securely and protects user data. The 2025 Legislative Session will likely be pivotal in shaping the direction of AI’s role in Idaho’s government, balancing the excitement for innovation with the need for proper guidance and safeguards. As Gonzalez highlighted, the future of AI in Idaho may involve major efficiencies, but only with careful planning and human oversight.

The Idaho Artificial Intelligence Working Group met on December 17th, 2024 for the second time since Its formation. With the new year underway, s tate government employees will continue to experiment with and use generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) in various ways. This marks a significant step for Idaho but also reveals some challenges in terms of adoption, regulatory concerns, and employee readiness. The survey, which included 2,802 responses from employees across 45 state agencies, provides a snapshot of AI’s current use and perceptions in Idaho’s state government. While 65% of employees are aware of generative AI, only 23% reported that their agencies are currently using it. Around 51% of respondents indicated their agencies aren’t using AI yet, while 23% are still exploring its potential applications. These results suggested that, while interest in AI is high, actual implementation has been slow. Many agencies are taking a cautious approach, with concerns over data privacy, ethical implications, and AI's impact on jobs, and rightfully so. The survey highlighted a notable balance of enthusiasm and skepticism about AI’s role in government work. Despite the concerns, the survey results reflect a growing recognition of AI's potential. Many employees have seen AI improve efficiency, enhance service delivery, and support decision-making processes. For example, AI has already been deployed for tasks like automating document generation, analyzing images and videos, and providing customer service through chatbots. These applications are helping Idaho state agencies reduce manual work, save time, and increase overall productivity. Looking ahead, there is significant interest in expanding AI's use across different functions within the state government. Employees have expressed interest in leveraging AI to automate additional processes, improve content creation, and enhance data analysis capabilities. This is seen as an opportunity to streamline operations and address staff shortages by reducing the need for new full-time employees. While the potential benefits of AI are clear, the survey also uncovered widespread concern over the risks associated with its use. Data privacy emerged as the top issue, with employees fearing that sensitive data could be exposed if used improperly in AI systems. There is also an awareness of AI's societal and environmental impacts, raising questions about fairness, bias, and job displacement.
