Overview
Yes, in most cases. Employment relationships without a specific term exists at the will of both parties and can be terminated by either party upon notice to the other. No minimum length of notice (for example, a two-week notice) is required. Contracts specifying a term of employment, however, can pre-empt the at-will provision.
Generally, no. If an employee may use their time effectively for their own purposes (run errands, attend a birthday party, etc.), and even with some restrictions (no alcohol consumption), an employee is considered “waiting to be engaged” and therefore the employer does not have to compensate the employee for time on-call, so long as no work is performed. Excessive limitations, however, may be deemed compensable depending on the specific circumstances of a situation.
