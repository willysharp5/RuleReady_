Covered Employees
In New Jersey there is no statutory requirement that a private employer pay your salary during juror service. Whether or not your employer pays you for jury duty depends on your employment situation, including employers' policies, union contracts, etc. The State of New Jersey will pay you the appropriate juror fee as set forth in the New Jersey statutes. The Jury Management Office is aware that many employers do not pay their employees during jury duty. If service as a juror will create a severe financial hardship, as set forth in _N.J.S.A._ 2B:20-10, you may request to be excused. But please be aware that nonpayment by your employer, by itself, is not a valid reason to be excused from service. Each situation will be reviewed individually.
- **You are a healthcare worker directly involved in the care of a person with a mental or physical disability, and your continued presence is essential to the regular and personal treatment of that person.**
You will be required to submit a letter from your school superintendent confirming you are full time instructional staff and indicating either an excuse is necessary due to the volume of teachers called at the time or you are a special education teacher and it is essential for you to be in attendance.
