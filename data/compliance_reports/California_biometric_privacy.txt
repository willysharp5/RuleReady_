AI systems affect nearly all aspects of everyday life. Businesses use AI systems to evaluate consumers’ credit risk and guide loan decisions, screen tenants for rentals, and target consumers with ads and offers. AI systems are used in the workplace to guide employment decisions, in educational settings to provide new learning systems, and are widespread in health care settings where they’re used to guide medical diagnosis and treatment, healthcare provider operations, and insurance coverage decisions.

“California is an economic powerhouse built in large part on technological innovation. And right alongside that economic might is a strong commitment to economic justice, workers’ rights, and competitive markets. We’re not successful in spite of that commitment — we’re successful because of it,” **said Attorney General Bonta.**“AI might be changing, innovating, and evolving quickly, but the fifth largest economy in the world is not the wild west; existing California laws apply to both the development and use of AI. Companies, including healthcare entities, are responsible for complying with new and existing California laws and must take full accountability for their actions, decisions, and products.”

AI systems are novel and complex, and their inner workings are often not understood even by developers and entities that use AI, resulting in situations where AI tools have generated false information or biased and discriminatory results. Moreover, many consumers and patients are not aware of when and how AI systems are used in their lives or by institutions that they rely on, including how medical providers use AI to make decisions affecting health and healthcare.
This advisory provides an overview of many existing California laws that may apply to entities who develop, sell, or use AI, including consumer protection, civil rights, competition, data protection laws, and election misinformation laws.
