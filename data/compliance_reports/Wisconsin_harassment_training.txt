The first is when an employer, supervisor or co-worker singles a person out for harassment because of that person's race, color, creed, ancestry, national origin, age (40 and up), disability, sex, arrest or conviction record, marital status, sexual orientation or military services. The second situation is when the content of the harassment itself relates directly to any of these protected characteristics (e.g. sexual harassment, use of derogatory ethnic or religious terms, age or disability related comments).

Harassment may include verbal abuse, epithets, and vulgar or derogatory language, display of offensive cartoons or materials, mimicry, lewd or offensive gestures, and telling of jokes offensive to the above protected class members. The behavior must be more than a few isolated incidents or casual comments. It involves a pattern of abusive and degrading conduct directed against a protected class member that is sufficient to interfere with their work or create an offensive and hostile work environment.
- Realize that as a supervisor or owner you are "at risk" anytime you have an intimate relationship with a subordinate, even though your present relationship is not harassing and may not affect employment decisions. Policies that regulate social contact between supervisors and subordinates, including requirements that such contact be divulged by supervisors, are within an employer's rights under the Fair Employment Law.

Training Requirements
- Provide training to educate employees on the issue of harassment and periodically remind them of your strong desire to maintain a harassment free workplace.

Training Deadlines
The statute of limitations for filing a complaint is 300 days from the date the action was taken or the individual was made aware the action was taken.

Employer Notification Requirements
- Have multiple avenues in place for making an internal complaint and regularly inform employees about the complaint process. A "victim-friendly" complaint procedure encourages employees to come forward, is sensitive to their situation, stresses the need for confidentiality and ensures that retaliation will not occur, whatever the investigation outcome is.
- Keep lines of communication open. Make sure the complaining employee is informed of your efforts to correct any harassing behavior (including information about the consequences to the harasser) and of your desire to be promptly notified if problems persist or if retaliation occurs.
