# Pregnant Workers Fairness Act
The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (PWFA) became effective on June 27, 2023. This federal law aims to protect the rights of pregnant employees by requiring employers to provide accommodations for known limitations resulting from pregnancy, childbirth, and related medical conditions.

What Should Employers Do?
PWFA requires the university to engage in the interactive process to identify reasonable accommodations. Under the PWFA, reasonable accommodations are intended to enable an employee to remain in active work status.
It is important to note that unlike the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), no disability is required for reasonable accommodations under the PWFA. The PWFA requires only that there be a known limitation related to pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical condition.
1. Inform an Ohio University representative (e.g., your supervisor, H.R. Liaison, Accessibility Services staff, etc.) that you have a limitation related to pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical condition. (Note: You are not required to provide documentation of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical condition to your supervisor)
2. Inform an Ohio University representative (e.g., your supervisor, H.R. Liaison, Accessibility Services staff, etc.) that you require accommodations (a change or adjustment at work due to your limitation). The notification can be in person, in writing, or electronically — any method qualifies as notification.

Special Requirements
Once you’ve communicated a need for an accommodation to your supervisor, your supervisor will notify Accessibility Services, or you may elect to reach out to [Accessibility Services](https://www.ohio.edu/accessibility) directly at [access@ohio.edu](mailto:access@ohio.edu) or 740.593.2620 or by **submitting a confidential request for accommodation at** [**Pregnant Workers Fairness Act - Application for Accommodation Form**](https://cm.maxient.com/reportingform.php?OhioUniv&layout_id=107). An Accessibility Services staff member will work with you to coordinate the interactive process. This may involve Accessibility Services consultation with your supervisor concerning the implementation of reasonable accommodations, determining the need for additional information, and communicating with you about the details of current and/or anticipated accommodation needs.

Employer Responsibilities & Deadlines
It is important to note that unlike the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), no disability is required for reasonable accommodations under the PWFA. The PWFA requires only that there be a known limitation related to pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical condition.
1. Inform an Ohio University representative (e.g., your supervisor, H.R. Liaison, Accessibility Services staff, etc.) that you have a limitation related to pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical condition. (Note: You are not required to provide documentation of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical condition to your supervisor)
Employees do not have to use specific words such as PWFA or accommodations to begin the interactive request process but must indicate a limitation to performing their job. Contact [Accessibility Services](https://www.ohio.edu/accessibility) at [access@ohio.edu](mailto:access@ohio.edu) or [740.593.2620](tel:7405932620) (even if the employee is not a direct report or works in a different department) to share the employee’s notification and any accommodation requests.

Employer Notification Requirements
## Information for OHIO Employees
More information about the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act can be found on the [U.S Equal Employment Opportunity Commission](https://www.eeoc.gov/wysk/what-you-should-know-about-pregnant-workers-fairness-act) website.
1. Inform an Ohio University representative (e.g., your supervisor, H.R. Liaison, Accessibility Services staff, etc.) that you have a limitation related to pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical condition. (Note: You are not required to provide documentation of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical condition to your supervisor)

Posting Requirements
Not specified in available documentation

Recordkeeping Requirements
1. Inform an Ohio University representative (e.g., your supervisor, H.R. Liaison, Accessibility Services staff, etc.) that you have a limitation related to pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical condition. (Note: You are not required to provide documentation of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical condition to your supervisor)
We can’t require an employee to accept accommodation outside of an interactive process, deny employment opportunities, or require an employee to take leave if another reasonable accommodation can be provided under PWFA. If you are modifying an employee’s work schedule, responsibilities, or work location, be sure to keep Accessibility Services involved before making those decisions and implementing them.
4. Ohio University (and you as a manager) should not ask for supporting documentation when an employee shares an accommodation request under PWFA. This is a critical area of distinction between the PWFA and ADA. In the case of PWFA accommodation requests, documentation may be deemed necessary in rare instances but allow Accessibility Services to provide guidance if that occurs.
