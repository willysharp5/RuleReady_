Special Requirements
Under the federal [Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA)](https://www.minimum-wage.org/articles/fair-labor-standards-act), payday laws (and many other labor laws) were designed especially to protect hourly employees, rather than highly-compensated salaried employees. Therefore, payday laws often exempt or have looser requirements for employees considered to be "executives, professionals, or administrative employees". Outside salespeople, who are often paid on commission, are also often exempt from payday laws.
