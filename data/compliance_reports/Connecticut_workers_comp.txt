Connecticut Workersâ€™ Compensation Requirements

Overview
While statutes prescribe what the workers' compensation system does, how benefits are provided to injured workers, and what administrative work must occur to run the system, often it is an administrative regulation that specifies the details participants in the system must follow. While regulations are not statutes, they do carry the force of law, second only to the statutes themselves.
