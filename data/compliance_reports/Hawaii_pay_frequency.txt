Hawaii Pay Frequency & Payday Timing

Overview
Section 388-7(1), Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS), of the Payment of Wages and Other Compensation Law, requires every employer to notify the employer’s employees in writing, at the time of hiring of the rate of pay (if paid by commissions, the commission agreement), and of the day, hour, and place of payment. As opined by California’s Division of Labor Standards Enforcement, the commission agreement should be “clear and unambiguous” as to how and when commissions are “earned.” As it relates to Section 388-2, HRS, until those conditions as stipulated in the commission agreement are met, the commissions would not be considered “earned.” However, once the conditions for earning a commission have been met, the earned commissions must be paid within seven days after the end of the pay period in which the commissions were earned.
An example of willful or intentional disregard would be if the employee admits that he/she intentionally damaged the property. The employer may deduct the cost of the loss provided the employer obtains a written authorization from the employee. However, if the employer requires the employee to bear the expense, the cost cannot reduce the employee’s equivalent wages below the [statutory minimum wage](https://labor.hawaii.gov/wsd/minimum-wage/).
