Massachusetts Non-Compete Enforcement Rules

Overview
[MGL c. 149, § 24L](https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleXXI/Chapter149/Section24l) Massachusetts Noncompetition Agreement Act
These laws ban noncompetition agreements for certain professions:

Covered Employers
An "anti-raiding" restrictive covenant is “only reasonable, and thus enforceable, if it is (1) necessary to protect a legitimate business interest, (2) reasonably limited in time and space, and (3) consonant with the public interest.”
[F. A. Bartlett Tree Expert Company vs. Barrington](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4521927265214574074), 353 Mass. 585 (1968)
"It has been long settled in this Commonwealth that a covenant inserted in a contract for personal service restricting trade or competition or freedom of employment is not invalid and may be enforced in equity provided it is necessary for the protection of the employer, is reasonably limited in time and space, and is consonant with the public interest. What is reasonable depends on the facts in each case."

Covered Employees
- [MGL c. 112, § 135C](https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleXVI/Chapter112/Section135C) Social workers
"...\[T\]he Chair of the FTC is encouraged to consider working with the rest of the Commission to exercise the FTC’s statutory rulemaking authority under the Federal Trade Commission Act to curtail the unfair use of non-compete clauses and other clauses or agreements that may unfairly limit worker mobility."
"The final rule provides that it is an unfair method of competition for persons to, among other things, enter into non-compete clauses (“non-competes”) with workers on or after the final rule's effective date."
